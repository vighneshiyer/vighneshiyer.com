= Overview

I am a graduating EECS PhD student from UC Berkeley, specializing in computer architecture.
I am a generalist with skills spanning hardware engineering (RTL design, verification, architecture, physical design, prototyping, PCB design, silicon bringup) and software engineering (functional programming, hardware modeling, firmware, Linux).
I am looking for opportunities to apply first-principles, full-stack engineering to greenfield custom silicon projects, but I am also capable of working with large, mature, hardware codebases.

    - Worked on a functional API for random stimulus generation that decouples the description of constraints from the interpreter that generates legal stimulus. In doing so, we enable automatic extraction of the randomization graph for stimulus embedding and coverage for the generator itself as well as the generated stimulus.
    - Worked on a monadic simulation API for high-performance testbench fork/join threading.
    - Worked on power modeling techniques that use selective signal sampling and event traces to estimate energy. Leveraged formal methods for trace generation for power model training.
    - Worked on verification libraries for Chisel circuits with 2 MS students to create an API for constrained random stimulus generation, assertion based verification, transaction-level testing with VIPs, and cosimulation coupling a functional simulator with the RTL simulation of an accelerator written in Chisel
    - Investigated the usage of specification mining for RTL bug localization by mining LTL properties from simulation waveforms and checking properties on failing simulations
    - Worked on a systolic array based, dataflow configurable, GEMM accelerator generator (Gemmini) tightly coupled to a RISC-V core, designed for ML inference workloads
    - Worked on the physical design and verification of a multicore RISC-V chip taped out in TSMC16
    - TA'ing EECS 151/251A (Digital Design and ICs); led students through FPGA labs and the design of a pipelined RISC-V processor; teach discussion sections
