A bunch of random recipes I like or I thought were interesting.

## Pasta Dishes

### Cacio e Pepe



## Drinks

### Sleep Potions

- Level 1: 5g glycine + honey in chammomile tea with magnesium glycinate capsules
- Level 2: Level 1 + melatonin (low dose, ~1mg) and L-Theanine

### Electrolyte Drinks

#### Chef John's Homemade Gatorade

- [Homemade Sports Drink](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/246681/homemade-sports-drink-aka-greaterade/)
- Ingredients
  - 8 cups fresh cold water, divided
  - 3 tablespoons honey
  - ½ teaspoon fine Himalayan pink salt
  - ¾ teaspoon calcium magnesium powder (Optional)
  - 1 pinch cayenne pepper
  - ¾ cup freshly squeezed orange juice, strained
  - 2 medium lemons, juiced
  - 2 medium limes, juiced
- In 1 cup water, heat all the ingredients on low heat and whisk until everything is combined, then add the remaining water and chill

#### Posca

[Posca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posca) was an Ancient Roman drink for soldiers.
See: [The Incredible Spiced Wine of Ancient Rome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40uw6VkWpaI).

> As an archaeologist I've tried a very similar drink - essentially the same type of origin, roman legionnaires - that one of my teachers took to one of our Byzantine classes. She called it "Phouska", and the recipe we used was 1.5 cups of vinegar, 0.5 cup of honey, 1 tablespoon of crushed coriander seed, and 4 cups of water, then boiling it until the honey is dissolved and then straining the coriander seeds. It's actually one of my favorite archaeological/historical dishes (closely tied with Babylonian date-and-nut bars, which I would eat daily if I wasn't allergic to nuts XD), and one Christmas I actually drank a few liters of Phouska across a couple of days.

#### More Electrolyte Recipes

> For optimal sports performance, mix:
>
> - Spring water
> - A couple tablespoons of raw honey
> - Two large pinches high quality mineral salt with sodium, chloride, potassium and magnesium
>
> > Also add ACV and lemon to break down honey, add coconut water, maybe pink salt

- [@SolBrah](https://twitter.com/SolBrah/status/1759356618297266457)

> Spring water, Raw honey, Sol salts, Fresh lemon, Creatine

> Electrolyte supplements must have some very high mark-ups. Most are literally just salt and potassium and retail for over a dollar a serving.

- Redmond's salt, NoSalt, magnesium glyc, lemon, lime juice, inositol (optional)
- Coconut water
- Water + celtic salt + lemon juice + honey

#### Snake Juice

Original Recipe

- No more than 2L of water per day is really needed unless you are doing lots of physical activity
- Start with slighly less sodium per L (1000mg) since 2g/L is the high-limit
- 2000mg/L (approx 1 tsp) of sodium (himalayan pink salt)
- 4700mg/day (approx 2 tsp) of potassium chloride
- 8 tbsp/day of lemon juice (can use bottled lemon juice or can squeeze fresh)
- 4 tbsp/day of ACV
- Use a high Ph water (Ph > 7, Alkalinity > 120ppm)
    - Avoid tap water, use Evian or other high-Ph water (use Ph strips to test water), tap water can be OK if properly checked

Current Recipe

- Slightly different than the initial video; probably introduces more essential ingredients (such as magnesium)
- Also Cole recommends not using ACV or lemon juice in the snake juice but drinking them separately since they are acidic and will erode enamel if you don't brush soon
- Water=2L
- Potassium chloride = 1 tsp (No Salt)
- Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
- Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
- Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)

#### Trying to Devise My Own Recipe

- Existing powders
  - [Liquid IV](https://www.liquid-iv.com/pages/ingredients): Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), "natural flavors", stevia, silicon dioxide (no value), dipotassium phosphate ("provides" potassium, but no value), citric acid, B vitamin powders (B3, B5, B6, B12), potassium citrate (potassium equivalent to 1 banana), sodium citrate (sodium salt found in citric acid), salt, dextrose (sugar)
  - [LMNT](https://drinklmnt.com/pages/ingredients/?): 1000mg sodium (as salt), 200mg potassium (as potassium chloride), 60mg magnesium (as magnesium malate)
    - Recipe: 1/2 teaspoon salt (1g sodium), 500mg potassium citrate (200mg potassium), 1/4 teaspoon magnesium malate (60mg magnesium)
    - [Detailed explanation of the LMNT salt ratios](https://science.drinklmnt.com/electrolytes/lmnts-electrolyte-ratios-explained/) (10:2:0.6)
    - [Recipes](https://science.drinklmnt.com/electrolytes/best-homemade-electrolyte-drink-for-dehydration/): 1/2 teaspoon salt, 400mg potassium chloride (200mg potassium), 1/4 teaspoon magnesium malate (60mg magnesium) + 2 tablespoons lime juice + 16/32 oz water

- The base ingredients
  - Salts
    - Sodium/chloride
      - **Options**: **RealSalt**, sea salt, pink salt, baking soda
      - **Decision**: RealSalt (natural, clean)
    - Potassium/phosphorous
      - **Options**: potassium phosphate, potassium citrate, potassium chloride, **potassium gluconate**, potassium sulfate
      - **Decision**: potassium gluconate (lowest chance of digestive issues)
    - Magnesium
      - **Options**: magnesium citrate, chelated magnesium (bis)glycinate, magnesium L-Threonate, magnesium taurate, **magnesium malate**
      - **Decision**: magnesium malate, citrate (cheap, bad for digestion), bisglycinate (better for pre-sleep supplementation)
    - Calcium
      - **Options**: calcium citrate, calcium ascorbate
      - **Decision**: Calcium seems unnecessary
    - Zinc
      - **Options**: zinc citrate
      - **Decision**: Zinc also seems unnecessary

    - **Options**: honey, **sugar**, dextrose
    - **Decision**: organic cane sugar (easy to dissolve, cheap)
  - Acidity
    - **Options**: ACV, red wine vinegar, fruit (orange, **lime, lemon**), citric acid
    - **Decision**: lime/lemon juice (cheap, tasty, fresh)
  - Vitamins
    - **Potential additions**: Vitamin C, Vitamin B complex
    - **Decision**: Unnecessary
  - Trace Minerals
    - **Options**: **ConcenTrace Drops** (from Salt Lake, Utah), BioTrace Drops (from Dead Sea, Jordan), **Lugol's iodine**, Shilajit resin (high potency variability, see Nootropics Depot PrimaVie)
    - **Decision**: Lugol's iodine (2 drops), Concentrace drops (5-10 drops, also supplies magnesium)
  - Extras:
    - **Potential additions**: BCAA, creatine, ionic boron
    - **Decision**: Unnecessary

- Proposed recipe (for 1 liter of water ~32 oz)
  - 1000mg sodium (as RealSalt: 1.4g = 530mg sodium → 2.64g of RealSalt for 1000mg of sodium)
  - 200mg potassium ()
  - 60mg magnesium ()
  - Lugol's Iodine
  - Sugar
  - Lemon/lime juice
