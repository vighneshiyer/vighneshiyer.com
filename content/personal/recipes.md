A bunch of random recipes I like or I thought were interesting.

## Drinks

### Electrolyte Drinks

#### Chef John's Homemade Gatorade

- [Homemade Sports Drink](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/246681/homemade-sports-drink-aka-greaterade/)
- Ingredients
  - 8 cups fresh cold water, divided
  - 3 tablespoons honey
  - ½ teaspoon fine Himalayan pink salt
  - ¾ teaspoon calcium magnesium powder (Optional)
  - 1 pinch cayenne pepper
  - ¾ cup freshly squeezed orange juice, strained
  - 2 medium lemons, juiced
  - 2 medium limes, juiced
- In 1 cup water, heat all the ingredients on low heat and whisk until everything is combined, then add the remaining water and chill

#### Posca

[Posca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posca) was an Ancient Roman drink for soldiers.
See: [The Incredible Spiced Wine of Ancient Rome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40uw6VkWpaI).

> As an archaeologist I've tried a very similar drink - essentially the same type of origin, roman legionnaires - that one of my teachers took to one of our Byzantine classes. She called it "Phouska", and the recipe we used was 1.5 cups of vinegar, 0.5 cup of honey, 1 tablespoon of crushed coriander seed, and 4 cups of water, then boiling it until the honey is dissolved and then straining the coriander seeds. It's actually one of my favorite archaeological/historical dishes (closely tied with Babylonian date-and-nut bars, which I would eat daily if I wasn't allergic to nuts XD), and one Christmas I actually drank a few liters of Phouska across a couple of days.

> For optimal sports performance, mix:
>
> - Spring water
> - A couple tablespoons of raw honey
> - Two large pinches high quality mineral salt with sodium, chloride, potassium and magnesium
>
> > Also add ACV and lemon to break down honey, add coconut water, maybe pink salt

> Electrolyte supplements must have some very high mark-ups. Most are literally just salt and potassium and retail for over a dollar a serving.

- Redmond's salt, NoSalt, magnesium glyc, lemon, lime juice, inositol (optional)
- Coconut water
- Water + celtic salt + lemon juice + honey

#### Snake Juice

Original Recipe

- No more than 2L of water per day is really needed unless you are doing lots of physical activity
- Start with slighly less sodium per L (1000mg) since 2g/L is the high-limit
- 2000mg/L (approx 1 tsp) of sodium (himalayan pink salt)
- 4700mg/day (approx 2 tsp) of potassium chloride
- 8 tbsp/day of lemon juice (can use bottled lemon juice or can squeeze fresh)
- 4 tbsp/day of ACV
- Use a high Ph water (Ph > 7, Alkalinity > 120ppm)
    - Avoid tap water, use Evian or other high-Ph water (use Ph strips to test water), tap water can be OK if properly checked

Current Recipe

- Slightly different than the initial video; probably introduces more essential ingredients (such as magnesium)
- Also Cole recommends not using ACV or lemon juice in the snake juice but drinking them separately since they are acidic and will erode enamel if you don't brush soon
- Water=2L
- Potassium chloride = 1 tsp (No Salt)
- Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
- Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
- Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)

#### Trying to Devise My Own Recipe

- Existing powders
  - [Liquid IV](https://www.liquid-iv.com/pages/ingredients): Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), "natural flavors", stevia, silicon dioxide (no value), dipotassium phosphate ("provides" potassium, but no value), citric acid, B vitamin powders (B3, B5, B6, B12), potassium citrate (potassium equivalent to 1 banana), sodium citrate (sodium salt found in citric acid), salt, dextrose (sugar)
  - [LM]
- The base ingredients
  - Salts
    - sodium (RealSalt, sea salt, pink salt, baking soda)
    - potassium/phosphorous (potassium phosphate)
    - magnesium (magnesium citrate - cheap and not good, chelated magnesium (bi)glycinate - ideal, ionic magnesium)
    - chloride (NaCl)
    - calcium (calcium citrate, calcium ascorbate)
    - zinc (zinc citrate)
  - Sugars: honey / cane sugar
  - Acidity: ACV / red wine vinegar / fruit (orange, lime, lemon) / citric acid
  - Vitamins: Vitamin C, Vitamin B complex
  - Trace Minerals: Trace Minerals ConcenTrace Drops (from Salt Lake, Utah) / BioTrace Drops (from Dead Sea, Jordan), Lugol's iodine, Shilajit resin (high potency variability, see Nootropics Depot PrimaVie)
  - Extras: BCAA, creatine, ionic boron, glycine
