A bunch of random recipes I like or I thought were interesting.

## Ingredients

- [High in plant polyphenols](https://twitter.com/Mangan150/status/1598691696023199747) (highest to lowest)
  - Dark chocolate, black tea, pomegranate juice, red wine, red onion, green tea, beet, coffee, white wine, broccoli, hot chocolate, carrot, tomato

## Pasta Dishes

### Cacio e Pepe

- [NOT ANOTHER COOKING SHOW: The Secret to the Creamiest Cacio e Pepe Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBg0DiHTImU)
  - [Recipe](https://www.notanothercookingshow.tv/post/the-4-greatest-methods-for-creamy-cacio-e-pepe)
  - Stick to the original method of making the sauce in the pan by aggressively stirring the pecorino into the pasta water
  - Use 1 tbsp of peppercorns per serving, toast on a flame until fragrant, then crush with mortar and pestle
  - Use 4oz (approx 114g) of spaghetti per serving
  - Grate plenty of pecorino (2-3oz per serving) on a very fine grate (either use the 'snow' holes in a box grater or a microplane)
  - **Do not** use salt in the pasta boiling water
  - Keep the pan for sauce making warm, but not on a flame. Add pasta water to the pepper 2-3 minutes before the pasta is al dente.
  - Stir aggressively when making the sauce. Make sure the pasta **has cooled down** (wait 1 minute) before adding pecorino or it will become clumpy and stringy. Add a little pecorino (2 handfuls, then the rest slowly) at a time along with pasta water to maintain temperature under 180F.
  - Before plating, warm plates in microwave for 30 seconds to get hot
- Retrospective after 3/24/2024 preparation
  - I overcooked the pasta, it was a bit past al dente - should pull pasta as soon as it reaches al dente
  - The sauce pan was too hot when adding pecorino; I need to let the pasta cool for 1 minute along with the pasta water before I add cheese
  - The sauce was overall quite creamy, but slightly clumpy and stringy - this is due to poor temperature control, and not enough vigorous mixing
  - I used too much pepper (need to stick with 1 tbsp / serving or a bit less even)
  - I should use higher quality pasta (bronze cut square spaghetti De Cecco) and fresher pecorino
  - I tried to make garlic bread, but I only started it after I pulled the pasta - need to start it earlier and keep it under low flame until serving
  - It's hard to grate enough pecorino - I should use the microplane vs the box grater

### Pasta with Tomato Cream Sauce

- [Revolution| Spaghetti with tomato cream sauce using tomato paste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVe3_SdgRpc)
  - Melt unsalted butter, add tomato paste and mash and stir fry until the tomato is fragrant
  - Immediately add heavy cream and stir aggressively until completely mixed, adjust tomato paste and cream until the color matches that of the video and the consistency is thick
  - DO NOT add salt - there will be plenty of salt in the pasta and cheese
  - Boil pasta (rigatoni, spaghetti) in salted water, transfer to sauce without draining fully, stir through
  - Top with microplaned parm or grana padano

## Sides

### Breads

#### Garlic Bread

- [NOT ANOTHER COOKING SHOW: how to make the EASIEST GARLIC BREAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umYStKsDpqU)
- My recipe
  - Smash together 5-10 garlic cloves, unsalted butter, parsley, parmesean in a mortar and pestle
  - Broil the bottom of Italian bread for 1 minute to get crispy and moisture resistant
  - Spread the mixture on top of the bread and cover with microplaned parmesean
  - Broil the top of the bread for a minute, rotating often, then pull and cut into pieces

#### Brie Crostini

- [Brie Crostini](https://www.yourhomebasedmom.com/brie-crostini/)
  - Very simple, toast baguette slices topped with brie cheese and fresh rosemary/thyme in an oven at 450F
  - Top with honey, serve warm

- [Feeding a Roman Legion | Posca & Laridum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj5vg2fjOtk)

> As an archaeologist I've tried a very similar drink - essentially the same type of origin, roman legionnaires - that one of my teachers took to one of our Byzantine classes. She called it "Phouska", and the recipe we used was 1.5 cups of vinegar, 0.5 cup of honey, 1 tablespoon of crushed coriander seed, and 4 cups of water, then boiling it until the honey is dissolved and then straining the coriander seeds. It's actually one of my favorite archaeological/historical dishes (closely tied with Babylonian date-and-nut bars, which I would eat daily if I wasn't allergic to nuts XD), and one Christmas I actually drank a few liters of Phouska across a couple of days.

<summary>Snake Juice</summary>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Original Recipe**</span>

- No more than 2L of water per day is really needed unless you are doing lots of physical activity
- Start with slighly less sodium per L (1000mg) since 2g/L is the high-limit
- 2000mg/L (approx 1 tsp) of sodium (himalayan pink salt)
- 4700mg/day (approx 2 tsp) of potassium chloride
- 8 tbsp/day of lemon juice (can use bottled lemon juice or can squeeze fresh)
- 4 tbsp/day of ACV
- Use a high Ph water (Ph > 7, Alkalinity > 120ppm)
    - Avoid tap water, use Evian or other high-Ph water (use Ph strips to test water), tap water can be OK if properly checked

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Current Recipe**</span>

- Slightly different than the initial video; probably introduces more essential ingredients (such as magnesium)
- Also Cole recommends not using ACV or lemon juice in the snake juice but drinking them separately since they are acidic and will erode enamel if you don't brush soon
- Water=2L
- Potassium chloride = 1 tsp (No Salt)
- Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
- Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
- Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)
