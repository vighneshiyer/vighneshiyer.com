A common refrain about rural living (or even life in Cupertino for that matter): "there is nothing to do". "What is there to do around here?"

- 'nothing to do' syndrome
  - what is being 'done' when people claim to 'do' things?
  - are you doing things or are things being done to you?

- fundamentally caused by *lack* of boredom, ironically enough. inability to be bored = no production, no creativity.

> It's interesting that a lot of things just "happen" to women, and much of a woman's emotional life is dealing with these things as they happen. This is the opposite of a man's view, which is to be the agent of change, and this naturally puts problem-solving as a primary skill.

I would forget about the 'women' aspect since many men exhibit this pattern too. The general concept is true however; the reality is that things 'happen' to you when you 'do something'. There is no agency when it comes to 'doing things' in the typical sense.
