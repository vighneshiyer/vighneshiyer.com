A common refrain about rural living (or even life in Cupertino for that matter): "there is nothing to do". "What is there to do around here?"

- 'nothing to do' syndrome
  - what is being 'done' when people claim to 'do' things?
  - are you doing things or are things being done to you?

- fundamentally caused by *lack* of boredom, ironically enough. inability to be bored = no production, no creativity.

> It's interesting that a lot of things just "happen" to women, and much of a woman's emotional life is dealing with these things as they happen. This is the opposite of a man's view, which is to be the agent of change, and this naturally puts problem-solving as a primary skill.

I would forget about the 'women' aspect since many men exhibit this pattern too. The general concept is true however; the reality is that things 'happen' to you when you 'do something'. There is no agency when it comes to 'doing things' in the typical sense.

The "doing things in the city" theory, you aren't doing things but rather things are happening to you and you perceive it as you being the agent of action (e.g. shopping)

# On Independence

- many people who claim to be 'independent' after (coming to America, living alone, having a job, earning income, no family or dependents)

## The Key Questions

- Independence from what?
- Modern "Independence" is dependence
- Independence to what end?

- "Self care" <-> inducing a superficial feeling of comfort

## Travel

- Travel is a related topic with the 'there is nothing to do around here' discussion
- I still don't know how to answer this question properly. Clearly there is some benefit to travel. But what are the steps to take to avoid it becoming a mindless consumptive activity?

> "i love to Travel" why have you failed to establish your home as a place of serenity and joy, to the extent that you feel psychically uncomfortable there and strive to get away from your life whenever you can, viewing it as the highest good?

> you are not well

> "i Travel" you can go wherever you like in the world but you will never escape yourself
>
> "i want to spend time with people different than myself!" no you dont. there are Different people in your city.

> go hang out with the homeless or some seniors hmmmm? i guarantee these people are more different from you than are your age and class peers in europe

> the only really good reason to travel recreationally is to see old friends and travel in this case is, in a real sense, like coming home after a long time spent away

- Consumptive | Light Consumption into the base of Production | Productive
  - bad to let consumption leak into production. e.g. listening to a podcast while trying to create something / exercise. best to consume with intention and then use leisure to let thoughts percolate and finally produce.
  - the middle is often called leisure and scholars / aristocrats spend much of their day in that middle zone. this is closely related to slavery vs free men (https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/d4eorn/nietzsche_and_free_time/).
  - 'there is nothing to do' = there isn't much purely consumptive activity to be done
  - consumptive behavior doesn't have to be useless! consuming writings and music is useful! but it isn't productive, and it is not in leisure either.
  - leisure can only happen with very light consumption (usually drinks like coffee) and with the intent of building thoughts for production. in other words, it is **idle time**. most people only experience leisure two times per day, and increasingly that is going to zero. on the toilet and in the shower / sitting in a bath. in fact, these are the only two i think normal people experience - and both of those are going away since normies listen to music while showering and they use their phone on the toilet. what a disaster.
