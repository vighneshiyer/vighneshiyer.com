The Pensieve Boddisathva lol

### Observations About Korea / Koreans

#### Metro and Chimes

No fare gates
Cute chimes, although watch out

#### Extreme competence

Having an all Korean staff is a game changer
No incompetence like we're used to in America. For example on my global entry interview, the bimbo customs agent asked me which countries I've been to in the past 5 years (Korea, Japan, UK, Canada, Mexico, India) and when she went to enter South Korea, she was confused about whether that was DPRK or ROK lmao. She interrupted the single competent White male customs agent to ask this critical question. This one White agent was being interrupted by the various brown and black agents to ask various questions as if they needed "training" to fill out a form on a computer. The level of incompetence in America has become absolutely intolerable over the past 10 years as Whites are displaced and a flood of low IQ racial hybrids fill various government and corporate jobs. Koreans have no idea how lucky they are that their fellow citizens are a homogenenous group, highly competent, and willing to fix problems. Calling companies on the phone is common place in Korea and no Korean thinks twice about whether to call to fix a problem - unlike America, where we try to avoid talking to morons on the phone as much as possible, not only because the staff is all outsourced and dealing with Indians is a huge pain (Filipinos less so), but also because

Competence, efficiency, and trust permeate all aspects of daily life in Korea, and Americans have no idea what they are missing out on. Older Americans remember a time when America was like this too, but after flooding this country with immigrants, demoralizing and drugging the native White population, and
Going to Korea made me even more racially aware than I had been before (and I was already an extremist).

See glasses, doctors, IV liquids, hospitals, phone stores, restaurants with kiosks and highly efficient and friendly wait staff, hagwons, pharmacies, dentists, electronics repair, public baths, government services, grocery stores

Literally only one negative experience in a Korean store and it was at a 7-11 in Myeongdong with a black american cashier. Wtf. Why was she working in Korea to begin with?

Dentist and optician competence was so good to see, nothing like America

#### Extreme Convenience

What does it mean? Think of the second-order meaning of conveience being so desirable for Koreans.
Americans live a very different life: we have a convenience store in our homes lol. Exactly crafted to our individual tastes, but at the cost of some convenience (but due to Costco delivery, even that isn't true anymore).
Home-centered life in America is quite different from the urban/public centered life in Korea.

The main stores, T money card
Prepackaged food dominance
Lots of single-use packaging waste is generated
Ice drinks in the winter, ice bottles + pre-packaged liquid
I feel the lifestyle and habits of Korean-Californians are the future of Koreans in Korea too (more health and environmentally conscious consumption)

#### Just Relax - No One Will Steal

#### Love-Oriented Society

korean love culture - internet nonsense is non-existent on the ground in Korea, everyone is together, although I may be too naive about this

#### Clean Streets and No Garbage

No beggars, no buskers, beautiful Metro,

#### Drinking Culture

#### Insect Living

#### Reasons for Low Birthrate

#### Marriage Services

#### Golf simulators

#### Natural Drying

#### Oddly no Massage Culture?

#### Kakao Friends and Cuteness

#### Lotte, Kakao, Samsung, LG, SK, Hyundai - Chaebol Dominated Society

#### University and Hagwon Culture

The H1B discourse and the braindead take by Vivek is the Korean way. Needless to say, it is un-American (and un-Greek and un-Roman and un-Renaissance) to the maximum degree.

But Koreans still find a way to live if placed outside the university system. Lots of small business proliferate and compete.

Extreme studying, but still can't outcompete the USA on PISA scores. What does this really buy koreans? Tiger Moms are very real. Megastudy convention. Sunung test.

#### Private vs Public Wealth

#### Korean Food and Drink

McDonalds breakfast is surprisingly good lol. Korean competence means I never have to worry about special things in my order being wrong.
Ginseng
Bibimbap - can be extremely good, some banchan is vegetarian
Gim
Juk - bonjuk
Sweet pancake thing
Potato and cheese rosti thing
Temple food
Pine bud drink

#### Korean Drinking Culture and Group-Orientation

#### Fine Granularity Trash Categorization

#### Willow Trees and Cute Birds

#### Public Parks

#### Shopping and Prices

#### Coffee / Cafe Culture

The competence of Koreans shines again here.

#### Korean Art Gallery Culture

#### Surrounded by Koreans (and It's Great)

#### The Korean Internet

Namu wiki
Completely segregated
Koreans don't consume nearly any English language Internet

#### Are Koreans Americanizing?

Costco is common nowadays
Koreans are looking for more space, but are continually flooding Seoul for money
Will density ever recover as birthrates continue to fall?

#### Are Koreans Aware of Their Surroundings?

Street lights on the ground
Extreme phone orientation
Random people run into you and don't make any attempt to dodge like Americans
They don't hold the door open for others
They randomly stop in the middle of the street, suddenly and you are forced to swerve around them

#### Dokdo Island

#### Fruit Culture

Even tomatoes are fruits here, have you seen cherry stevia tomatoes?

#### Sugary and Saucy Koreans

#### Photo Booth Culture

#### Youth Obsession and Surgery

#### Auto Sliding Doors Everywhere

#### Zokbo and Family Trees

#### Saying Hi to Strangers

America vs the rest of the world. Saying Hi, nodding, smiling at people on the street.

America is a very folksy place. Constant optimism is part of the social fabric.

 The rest of the world isn't like this.

#### The Importance of SKY

Doctors, dentists, optometrists, hagwons
No matter where you turn, there will be a SNU/Yonsei sign
SKY castle is real

#### Korean Red Ginseng

### My Regrets and My Next Trip

Temple visit
Try more foods and cafes, especially pastries and speciality coffee. Plan my meals!
Make more glasses
See more historical sites across Korea

## My Short Excursion to Osaka

### Trip Report

Wtf how is Japanese food quality so high? And the prices are low? Japan is too good indeed.

### Observations

#### Japanese Bathing Innovations

#### Japan vs Korea Gardens and Public Spaces

- Crammed ness vs planned city
- gardens that blend with nature vs stand out

#### Not So Modern In Some Ways

Cash is still king in Japan, cards aren't accepted in many places, including the subway

### Korea vs Japan for Tourists
