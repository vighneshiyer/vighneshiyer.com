# Lack of Respect - Flat Hierarchy

- What does it reflect? No professors want to be called professor anymore. They want to be your 'peers'. Same with your manager or boss. And even teachers are starting to make this fade. What is the problem here? Is it just a curse of modernity?
  - Certain cultures and languages (my own Tamil, but in particular Korean and Japanese) have a long history of respect to others - those are fading too.
- Hierarchies are flattening, but what is driving this? Is it a social phenomenon?
- Learning can't exist when students don't feel strictly inferior to their teacher with respect to the subject under question. It simply can't happen.
  - More than learning however. Feeling superior to your 'superiors' is extremely detrimental to productivity and motivation. Having all inferior peers and inferior people up the chain is demoralizing.
  - Consider dogs. Are most humans really that different? Without leadership, they go wild.
