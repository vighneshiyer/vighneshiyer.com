There are increasingly many stories like this. Fed my results into AI, got a very precise diagnosis with differential diagnosis criteria if asked for, and eventually I met an elite doctor who finally agreed with the AI's conclusion even as a multitude of doctors passed over the symptoms/lab results/contextual clues and gave no answers.

Mediocre doctors will be completely eradicated with the proliferation of AI. There will only be room for elite doctors. When I say 'eradicated' I don't mean they will cease to exist, but rather their status will be at rock bottom. Of course, due to doctor cartels like the AMA, people will continue to be forced to pay penance to these mediocre 'doctors'.

> What are the cartel like behaviors of doctor cartels like the AMA in the United States? Include cartels for pharmacists, optometrists, dentists, anestheiologists, and all other related disciplines.

- Complete cartel control over licensing, accreditation, seeing patients, insurance, medicines / pharmacies, lab testing, imaging, surgery, and on and on

- On the one hand there are general practice doctors all over the place; they don't always listen to you, they often charge insane rates to insurance, and they have 1000s of patients they see over a year
    - They are often affiliated with a hospital or university and can easily admit and coordinate care
- On the other hand there are **concierge doctors** who maybe see at most 100s of patients per year and are on a retainer so you can get same day appointments, and they often don't take insurance
    - They sometimes operate independently, but others are really good at arranging care if needed
- https://peterattiamd.com/how-to-find-a-good-doctor/
    - Looks like going with a mid-tier $200/mo concierge doctor is a good idea, high-end concierge doctors (e.g. Attia) charge upwards of 50-90k/year and are too exclusive
    - Having them order blood tests vs having to pay per visit (insurance copay) + having to struggle to convince them of blood tests that are required is a good tradeoff

    - This looks very impressive and also affordable ($149/month) with payments coming from FSA/HSA allowed!
    - The only issue is that the locations are limited and it's unknown to what extent they can order lab tests to be performed externally
- What do they track at every visit?

        - pulse and EKG and HRV and respiritory rate and blood O2 levels
        - real-time blood test, basic lipid panel and metabolic panel (but likely not blood counts)
            - see tracking of blood test results w/ ranges over time
            - I assume they aggregate previous blood tests into their system
        - genetic testing - 23andMe genetic data dump into their tool that estimates risks of various diseases based on any present markers
            - It looks like all the doctors just prescribe generic things: exercise, sleep, diet, meditation/prayer to counter any potential risks

  - A few good notes here. Doctors will barely do surface level investigation of any issue as it presents. This is understandable (I guess) since they are strapped for time and are effectively paid by the number of appointments they can stuff.
  - But things like black mold proliferation in the house, or really any environmental toxin, or the list of all supplements and medicines you take with a careful inventory of what nutrients are inside (to check for potential allergies, over/under provisioning and associated illnesses). Trying to do everything a functional doctor would try to do would end up consuming lots of time and it isn't backed by the "protocol". The adherence of doctors to "the protocol" is evidence of their mechanical thinking process, and to some degree, protection against malpractice claims.
  - LLMs do not suffer from limited time issues or lack of information (so long as the patient is very thorough and forces the model to consider all possibilities). But as long as language models can't prescribe tests or medicines or imaging, or anything of the nature, they will be quite limited. Not to say anything about procedures or surgeries! The times will change on all these axes soon enough however.
  - Doctors are also ignorant of the latest research on any condition. It is always prudent to consult a model which can scour and discover new findings. Dosing is also tricky for doctors who rely on the appointment method for adjusting doses in concert with lab testing, but this adjustment is always made ad-hoc and will not be optimally timed.

It takes a startup to do this. All these fake MRI costs. But something that's quite annoying is that they outsource the actual scans to a normal facility - the startup doesn't actually own anything. The lack of vertical integration is quite concerning and makes it seem like a reseller rather than a health provider that owns the stack. It can't be that much investment to own everything, so the overheads must come from somewhere else.

  - This is very very good work.

  - The only thing standing in the way of general-purpose doctor deprecation are their own cartels (with respect to medical licensing, medical prescriptions and pharmacies, insurance, diagnostic tests and imaging, among others). The things left are physical inspection and most importantly procedures - those aren't so amenable to automation as they aren't really about information and reasoning, but rather physical interaction. Dumping capital into the development of medical devices, surgical automation and robotics will be necessary for continued improvement in medicine. Rare disease research, drug development, and genetic manipulation (including gene and stem cell therapy) are still promising areas. Capital should not be spent in mechanical doctor-ing, which is where the vast majority of medical spending ends up today.
