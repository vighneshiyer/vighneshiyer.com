There are increasingly many stories like this. Fed my results into AI, got a very precise diagnosis with differential diagnosis criteria if asked for, and eventually I met an elite doctor who finally agreed with the AI's conclusion even as a multitude of doctors passed over the symptoms/lab results/contextual clues and gave no answers.

Mediocre doctors will be completely eradicated with the proliferation of AI. There will only be room for elite doctors. When I say 'eradicated' I don't mean they will cease to exist, but rather their status will be at rock bottom. Of course, due to doctor cartels like the AMA, people will continue to be forced to pay penance to these mediocre 'doctors'.

> What are the cartel like behaviors of doctor cartels like the AMA in the United States? Include cartels for pharmacists, optometrists, dentists, anestheiologists, and all other related disciplines.
