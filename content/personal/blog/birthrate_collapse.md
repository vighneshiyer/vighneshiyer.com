I hear about this so much, it gets hard to decipher what it actually means.
What I'm interested in:

- What is happening?
- Is there any historical precedent?
- What are the causes?
- Is it inevitable?
- Is it bad or good? With respect to what?
  - What are the real harms (if any)?
- Can it be reversed?

> This should read “the actual reason for the birth rate decline is women entering the **professional workforce outside of the home**”
>
> Women obviously worked in the past, and many were engaged in some form of labor that made money, like helping in the farm or manufacturing some goods at home that could be sold for extra money
>
> The difference is that women working at home can easily take care of a child.
>
> When women began entering the professional workforce and working in offices or factories, it raised the opportunity cost of having a child.
>
> The cost of having a child isn’t just the cost of raising the child and paying for food, shelter, clothes, and school. It’s also is the whatever income women gave up by missing work or quitting the workforce entirely.
>
> Chart is from Claudia Goldin who has studied the gender pay gap for decades and also recently won the Noble Prize. She says that the remaining gender pay gap is mostly due to changes in income for mothers. There is very little if any pay gap between men and childless women.
>
> Arguably the largest cost today for expectant mothers is not the cost of raising a child but the opportunity cost, such as lost time at work and lost income from not working.
>
> Basically, as more women enter the workforce and make more money, they incur higher opportunity costs for childbirth. This doesn’t go away even if there is maternity leave since the pay is not the only thing you gain at work. You also gain skills and promotions.
>
> At the same time the demand for babies has also declined as more people leave religion and are raised to see their careers as the path to a meaningful life.
>
> A recent Pew Research Poll found that more than 75% of parents think that their child’s career is the very important, while only 25% or so care of their child has a kid or stays within the same religion.
>
> Essentially, the “value” of babies has gone down, while the value of the thing you sacrifice to have babies has gone way up. It’s no secret why more women are choosing careers over motherhood
>
> So not only has opportunity cost risen but demand has fallen.
>
> This pretty much explains the demographic cliff.

This is true, but it can't explain everything.

- Birthrate collapse
- Living space (the bap argument), animals don't breed in captivity, mice breeding collapses when density increases, see the photos on my tablet for roman era similarities, female liberation, lack of individual sovereignty
- Monetary factors don't play a significant role so it seems
- https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/there-are-many-threats-to-humanity.-a-low-birth-rate-isnt-one-of-them
- It is multi factorial, a trapping of modernity and it's forces, but importantly, modernity isn't modern
- Consider how loss of habitat affects animals, lack of breeding is a loss of life force in the species

> When the ordinary thought of a highly cultivated people begins to regard "having children" as a question of pros and cons, the great turning-point has come. For Nature knows nothing of pro and con. Everywhere, wherever life is actual, reigns an inward organic logic, an "it", a drive, that is utterly independent of waking-being, with its causal linkages, and indeed not even observed by it. The abundant proliferation of primitive peoples is a natural phenomenon, which is not even thought about, still less judged as to its utility or the reverse. When reasons have to be put forward at all in a question of life, life itself has become questionable.

Spengler provides plenty of historical context on this problem.

> Every species has mating rituals. If those mating rituals cannot be performed, they will not breed.
>
> That's why we say of some animals that they "won't breed in captivity". It isn't because they have abstract philosophical ideas about freedom and want to take a stand. It's because the zoo environment has some restriction that disrupts their mating rituals.
>
> In humans, these rituals are partially instinctive, but also must be adapted to culture, so parts of them must be learned.
>
> If these parts are not taught, because they're not understood, or because speaking of them openly is politically off-limits, the next generation will have trouble mating.

Where does this modern behavioral pathology come from?

> About a decade ago, China started doing a bunch of research and analysis around its (booming and hyper-competitive) after-school private tutoring industry. After several years of researchers and policymakers dissecting its impact on education, culture, families, students, society at large, etc., they decided to just shut the whole industry down entirely.
>
> One of the main findings cited in their policy rationale was that all the research indicated the after-school tutoring industry, in myriad ways, ultimately wound up exerting a chilling effect on fertility. Among other things, all the social, financial, emotional, competitive, and cultural pressures it imposed, along with the sheer time demands, had grown so overwhelming for families and students that many were having less children, or simply opting out of parenthood altogether.

Dumb education striving leads to all kinds of negative effects with very few positive ones. You can't extract intelligence from a rock. Related: [Aporia: Asian immigration and the signaling model of education](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/asian-immigration-and-the-signaling)
