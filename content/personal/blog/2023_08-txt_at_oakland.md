- Bias, moa, n:1 vs 1:1, demographics, something for everyone, highly manufactured with lyrics
- Management company hated, larger venue booked than needed, floor ticket, screaming not clapping, parasocial relationships, very good English skills
- Merch, would I go again?
- The ugly people, the dress code
- Fake notions of interparty loyalty
- The music itself, lipsync vs live singing, dancing, choreo
- Audience for girl groups vs boy groups and impacts on money and popularity in Korea and around the world
- The limited lifecycle of idol groups, especially boys in BTS competitive market
- Generations of idol groups and the growth of idol group manufacturers
- The fading of girl groups but staying power of bts
- Pirate fashion of boys and Seinfeld's puffy shirt
- Barking, jacket posing
