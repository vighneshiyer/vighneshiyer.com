Two great guys with a good idea and a concrete plan to fulfill a real market need.

The only big questions I have are 1) how does the company plan to make enough money with $1/month fees? 2) what VC pressure will the company have to deal with? 3) is this enough of a value proposition above and beyond holding VOO or similar low-fee ETFs or low-fee mutual funds? 4) is the mutual fund structure flexible enough to handle intra-day buy/sell? 5) payment for order flow will be a pressure applied to this company eventually, is is really OK to give in or are there real reservations here? 6) roboadvisors (wealthfront, etc.) also capture a significant portion of this market need, if your value proposition is mostly cost oriented, you need ways to prevent bloating of this company and a reliance on pure low-tech solutions (avoid bloating into other markets, e.g. crypto and so forth, which require more labor which raises fees, and so forth until the cost argument falls flat)?
