I mean just look at what we're dealing with. Instead of a factory job, the American middle class (now increasingly underclass), is doing 'gig work'. This is not even 'unskilled' labor, it is even lower than that.

And look at the person being featured: 15yo daughter without a mother (probably divorced), pays child support, have to support 2 boomer parents who are disabled and are just sitting at home, has an autistic brother who can't hold any real job, and all he can do is Uber Eats.

7.3 million Americans work in the 'gig economy'! Very insane abuse. And they are suspending random drivers while enabling the mass fraud of drivers who aren't in America legally, using someone else's identity to earn scraps through these apps. What value is being added here?

Who is building real value in America vs 'marketplaces' and various other rent seeking schemes and financialization? Well, there are so few. Tesla and SpaceX stand out. Musk could have gone the 'software financialization' route like the others in the Paypal mafia, but he was the only one who didn't.
