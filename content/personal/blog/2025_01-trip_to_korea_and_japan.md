The Pensieve Boddisathva lol

### Observations About Korea and Koreans

#### Metro and Chimes

No fare gates
Cute chimes, although watch out

#### Extreme competence

Having an all Korean staff is a game changer
No incompetence like we're used to in America. For example on my global entry interview, the bimbo customs agent asked me which countries I've been to in the past 5 years (Korea, Japan, UK, Canada, Mexico, India) and when she went to enter South Korea, she was confused about whether that was DPRK or ROK lmao. She interrupted the single competent White male customs agent to ask this critical question. This one White agent was being interrupted by the various brown and black agents to ask various questions as if they needed "training" to fill out a form on a computer. The level of incompetence in America has become absolutely intolerable over the past 10 years as Whites are displaced and a flood of low IQ racial hybrids fill various government and corporate jobs. Koreans have no idea how lucky they are that their fellow citizens are a homogenenous group, highly competent, and willing to fix problems. Calling companies on the phone is common place in Korea and no Korean thinks twice about whether to call to fix a problem - unlike America, where we try to avoid talking to morons on the phone as much as possible, not only because the staff is all outsourced and dealing with Indians is a huge pain (Filipinos less so), but also because

Competence, efficiency, and trust permeate all aspects of daily life in Korea, and Americans have no idea what they are missing out on. Older Americans remember a time when America was like this too, but after flooding this country with immigrants, demoralizing and drugging the native White population, and
Going to Korea made me even more racially aware than I had been before (and I was already an extremist).

See glasses, doctors, IV liquids, hospitals, phone stores, restaurants with kiosks and highly efficient and friendly wait staff, hagwons, pharmacies, dentists, electronics repair, public baths, government services, grocery stores

Literally only one negative experience in a Korean store and it was at a 7-11 in Myeongdong with a black american cashier. Wtf. Why was she working in Korea to begin with?

Dentist and optician competence was so good to see, nothing like America

> I went to the Cava in Wicker Park in Chicago a month ago. Lots of people there waiting in line. They want the food. they love the food. But the staff was out of ingredients. They didn't know what they were doing. The employees couldn't handle the to-go orders and the in-person orders. Everything was slow.
>
> When you go into a store and the owner is working there he is friendly and makes sure you are taken cared of. He has a stake in the business succeeding. Employees don't. They work for a wage. That's a misalignment.
>
> Why don't companies just tell employees that if stores make certain sales thresholds every month they'll get an extra few grand on their paycheck.

Low wage employees in Korea are still competent! Very efficient, always try to improve the job they do, and looking for responsibility. They are just superior in every way to what we have in America (at least in the modern era; likely not the America of 100 years ago).

- Another one: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562119 (Are people bad at their jobs or are the jobs just bad? (annehelen.substack.com))
  - No one in the comments wants to say the truth, this is about the intrinsic quality of the people, the quality of 'humans' in the US has been declining for a long time now, there is plenty of historical precedent for such declines in the quality of people

#### Extreme Convenience

What does it mean? Think of the second-order meaning of conveience being so desirable for Koreans.
Americans live a very different life: we have a convenience store in our homes lol. Exactly crafted to our individual tastes, but at the cost of some convenience (but due to Costco delivery, even that isn't true anymore).
Home-centered life in America is quite different from the urban/public centered life in Korea.

The main stores, T money card
Prepackaged food dominance
Lots of single-use packaging waste is generated
Ice drinks in the winter, ice bottles + pre-packaged liquid
I feel the lifestyle and habits of Korean-Californians are the future of Koreans in Korea too (more health and environmentally conscious consumption)

#### Just Relax - No One Will Steal

#### Love-Oriented Society

korean love culture - internet nonsense is non-existent on the ground in Korea, everyone is together, although I may be too naive about this

#### Clean Streets and No Garbage

No beggars, no buskers, beautiful Metro,

#### Drinking Culture

#### Insect Living

#### Reasons for Low Birthrate

#### Marriage Services

#### Golf simulators

#### Natural Drying

#### Oddly no Massage Culture?

#### Kakao Friends and Cuteness

#### Lotte, Kakao, Samsung, LG, SK, Hyundai - Chaebol Dominated Society

#### University and Hagwon Culture

The H1B discourse and the braindead take by Vivek is the Korean way. Needless to say, it is un-American (and un-Greek and un-Roman and un-Renaissance) to the maximum degree.

But Koreans still find a way to live if placed outside the university system. Lots of small business proliferate and compete.

Extreme studying, but still can't outcompete the USA on PISA scores. What does this really buy koreans? Tiger Moms are very real. Megastudy convention. Sunung test.

#### Private vs Public Wealth

#### Korean Food and Drink

McDonalds breakfast is surprisingly good lol. Korean competence means I never have to worry about special things in my order being wrong.
Ginseng
Bibimbap - can be extremely good, some banchan is vegetarian
Gim
Juk - bonjuk
Sweet pancake thing
Potato and cheese rosti thing (gamjajeon)
Temple food
Pine bud drink

#### Korean Drinking Culture and Group-Orientation

#### Fine Granularity Trash Categorization

#### Willow Trees and Cute Birds

#### Public Parks

#### Shopping and Prices

#### Coffee / Cafe Culture

The competence of Koreans shines again here.

#### Korean Art Gallery Culture

#### Surrounded by Koreans (and It's Great)

#### The Korean Internet

Namu wiki
Completely segregated
Koreans don't consume nearly any English language Internet

#### Are Koreans Americanizing?

Costco is common nowadays
Koreans are looking for more space, but are continually flooding Seoul for money
Will density ever recover as birthrates continue to fall?

#### Are Koreans Aware of Their Surroundings?

Street lights on the ground
Extreme phone orientation
Random people run into you and don't make any attempt to dodge like Americans
They don't hold the door open for others
They randomly stop in the middle of the street, suddenly and you are forced to swerve around them

#### Dokdo Island

#### Fruit Culture

Even tomatoes are fruits here, have you seen cherry stevia tomatoes?

#### Sugary and Saucy Koreans

#### Photo Booth Culture

#### Youth Obsession and Surgery

#### Auto Sliding Doors Everywhere

#### Zokbo and Family Trees

#### Saying Hi to Strangers

America vs the rest of the world. Saying Hi, nodding, smiling at people on the street.

https://x.com/PaulSkallas/status/1874935303359836531

America is a very folksy place. Constant optimism is part of the social fabric.

 The rest of the world isn't like this.

#### The Importance of SKY

Doctors, dentists, optometrists, hagwons
No matter where you turn, there will be a SNU/Yonsei sign
SKY castle is real

#### Korean Red Ginseng

#### Places to Shop

#### Maps

### My Regrets and My Next Trip

Temple visit
Try more foods and cafes, especially pastries and speciality coffee. Plan my meals!
Make more glasses
See more historical sites across Korea

## My Short Excursion to Osaka

### Trip Report

Wtf how is Japanese food quality so high? And the prices are low? Japan is too good indeed.

### Observations

#### Japanese Bathing Innovations

#### Japan vs Korea Gardens and Public Spaces

- Crammed ness vs planned city
- gardens that blend with nature vs stand out

#### Not So Modern In Some Ways

Cash is still king in Japan, cards aren't accepted in many places, including the subway

### Korea vs Japan for Tourists

## Random Notes

- Wealth wrt public and private places
- Lots of pharmacies everywhere ì•½
- Very easy to get lots of things done, America is a lot more internet centric about doing things
- Pine bud drink is very good but also very sweet, in general things are very sweet here
- Prepackaged foods are much more pronounced here and also on all levels of income, whereas american usage of prepackaged foods is considered low class
- Metro is very nice and very safe, unlike Bart where the announcements are about keeping your belongings in sight, the Korean metro announcements ate about not getting your slipper stuck in the escalator
- Quite easy to get around with only knowledge of English, seems like everyone speaks a little bit, enough to do things

- National geographic clothing https://m.blog.naver.com/sapharico/222320922593
- Plastic surgery extravaganza in Gangnam is real, lots of people with bandages walking around
- Lots of plastic surgery ads in the Gangnam subway underground mall
- 8seconds, topten, Giordano
- Uniqlo, Muji, beanpole
- No fare gates, insane

- Golf practice everywhere, but courses are basically inaccessible, indoor golf simulation is very popular
- Why do people leave Korea for America? Who left Europe for America? What are the characteristics? Why do people do it today? How does Japan compare?
- History of a place and it's relationship to what kind of people it attracts, worship of history vs rewriting an old history as a replay vs writing a new history, the allure of existing history is quite pulling
- Public photo culture in Japan and Korea vs america
- Public conversations and stranger interactions
- The value of labor, can you afford to have many bodies deployed as service workers?
- Korea vs Japan cycle tourism, mostly Koreans to Japan and not the other way around. I heard lots of Korean in Japan, but no Japanese in Korea
- Why do shrines not exist in Korea? Patronage, religious zeal, government support? What is Korean Christianity?
- PC bangs and video games, what do Koreans do on their phone? What the those lights on the ground at crosswalks? I have no clue about games actually but phone usage seems very similar to American in patterns
- Dokdo island, war propaganda on the subway, Korea still feels like a sore loser country. But the Japanese don't care at all. They just deny the war crimes and make a cute society. Cuteness is the Japanese cultural shield.
- Kimchi fridge, bottled water, toilet paper as napkins, gloves for dishwashing, lots of banchan that are preserved, trash segregation
- The different sounds and accents of Korean Japanese and Chinese and how they relate to the character of the people
  - Korean is quite harsh when spoken - yelling and cursing in Korean feels natural. Japanese is more fluid, less harsh, the tone is higher. Chinese can sound annoying to listen to.
- Korean news is similar to American ones, during the impeachment they were very focused but otherwise they just replay Twitter and ig tiktok clips and have facial reactions, that part is quite east Asian
- Koreans go to the doctor for any even slight illness, doctors see 100s of people a day, every apartment complex have multiple medical offices, even a cold is a visit to the doctor, overprescription of antibiotics is similar to India
  - See the statistics about doctor visits per capita per year, Korea is the highest in the world by far
  - Korean doctors have their own cartel. They held a boycott recently to prevent more people from entering their cartel and compromising their pricing power.
- Greenhouses everywhere once slightly outside Seoul, fruit culture, perfect fruits are a common gift and they do taste quite good, strawberries are common and high quality. Fruit quality is very high.
- 1000 baby credits (Seoul government is desperate for Koreans to breed, but even large boluses of money won't solve anything)
- Japan is very photo shy, very unlike America
- Korea is increasingly eradicating smoking
- Japanese tendency to miniaturization, Japanese gardens are about crafting an artificial world, Korean gardens are about blending into the existing landscape, very different

> One small problem with this plan: assimilation is largely a myth, or is superficial at best.
>
> The things above water that are easiest to see are what changes with immigrants. The things below water which are harder to see tend to be much more resistant to change. Hence the illusion of assimilation

- Above: language, folklore, arts, dress, literature, holidays/festivals, food
- Below: family roles, beliefs, assumptions, core values, relation to authority, self-concept, manners, biases, body language, beauty ideals, personal space, competitiveness, and on and on

- Fire safety is crucial, auto gas shutoff, supplies on every train and station, extinguishers everywhere, firewalls and deployment in all buildings
  - Reflection of Korean fear of fires from history of Japanese invasions
- Being surrounded by Koreans doesn't affect me in any way, I don't understand these browns and blacks who complain, I actually love seeing Koreans around me
- Natural drying
- No tap water
- Korean exasperation is unique
- Korean medicine is so good but doctors are overworked like residents in America
  - Same issue of pharma and doctor cartels, but it is even more acute in Korea, see the doctor walk offs recently
- No beggars and buskers, contrast with London underground and Bart and ny metro
- Salvation army, viewed with suspicion. In all the subway stations banging a bell. Asking for donations
- No cults I encountered
- Korean haircut
- Korean beauty standards vs in california
  - Light vs tan is one of the huge ones. California Koreans are tanned.
- Dog culture still hasn't kicked off unlike the us
- No graffiti
- Moving is easy and fast
- Honesty, minimal scamming, trust among people to do the job properly and efficiently
- Bart has bystander intervention cards, please ask the station office lmao

- Is social credit really so bad? Or rather is it the Chinese conception of it? Reputation based societies are crucial regardless, how can they scale efficiently? The handshake deal culture common among VCs
- After riding Bart, loud people, people going between trains constantly, homeless, dirt, smell, loud talking on phones, loitering, infinite problems
- No locks in convenience stores! Not a single one! Although there was lots of CCTV and monitoring screens and posters about it

- Trash cans aren't that common and they are not enclosed and transparent
- No graffiti! No littering. Restrooms exist in all public transit areas and they are clean and usable. Compare to the Berkeley Bart restroom, there is a clipboard and an officer standing there. A list of rules. I have a picture of this I have to put here!

- Oh fat people! They are not so common in the bay area and orange county vs the rest of America but still vs Korea, they have basically no fat people. The Korean diet is filled with sugar and carbs, but still no fat people, maybe that is changing slowly though. Korean moms are brutal towards their daughters, they constantly criticize their looks, fatness, hair, face, and so forth

- High trust society, keep baggage out at the airport, nothing will happen, use your phone to claim your spot in a cafe
- Fruit culture, such beautiful fruits for gifting!

- College is a big deal, see the snu and yonsei doctors! Compare to equivalent thing in America, moms are obsessed with snu medical
- See the bookstore things

- About pricing
- Base pricing is lower due to lower labor cost and other base goods efficiencies
- Then the currency advantage
- Then no tip and included tax
- And finally the Korean competence gives you way more value for money

- What are the sources of high prices in restaurants and grocery stores in America? At the consumer facing end, margins are actually quite low, so where is the value being lost? Inflation isn't a good explanation since the dollar is still stronger than these other currencies, does everything boil down to labor expense? In which case Chinese and even American robotization can be very successful so long as we can avoid the criminal cost which is easy for Chinese but maybe impossible for americans

- Another few interesting things
- Extreme inefficiency compared to Korea in restaurants that are counter order, like this falafel place, I like this kiosk culture and it also keeps the workers more efficient and avoids clogging
- Metro system, Starbucks, 711, bathroom lockers, extreme loud classic music to keep away loitering and other human garbage from floating around

- Waiting at the train station, lining up on both sides of each door, waiting for everyone to get off, moving to the side, still rushed Koreans though :disappointed:
- Transit leftists seem to understand the concept of induced demand when it comes to adding a lane to a road but they conveniently omit the induced demand caused by migration itself, there is no inherent justification for more biomass!

- Ultra spice consumption in China and Korea vs Japan
- Separate rice vs glutinous rice, chewy rice cakes in East ga South asia

### Japan

- Game towns in Japan, salarymen, hidden world, mostly impenetrable to outsiders due to language and connections, still very fun, don quixote, trains are excellent, old currency systems, electronics stores are insanely good, streets are very aesthetic, temples are so beautiful and hidden similar to indian cities, talk about the Korean lost history, Osaka castle, Neapolitan pizza is great, McDonald's is surprisingly very good, Japanese contact aversion, single person restaurants, single use thing proliferation, enormous plastic waste generated

- Fake foods in restaurants to advertise, pigeons are useful for cleaning, tourist trap dontori, outside surface of Japan is very accessible, hidden belly is truly only for Japanese and truly exceptional westerners, desire for European fashion during Edo era in 1500s morphed into the world wanting Japanese goods, Japanese good specialities only available domestically, nmn available OTC, same with nattokinase, the miracle from Japan,
- Japanese bathing and toilet innovations are world class and unbeatable, the quality of life improvement in that area is worth so much and no one knows it, same with public restrooms, Japan needs to exercise some more discretion wrt tourists, Koreans are a very different people I think, Japanese are the most masculine among east Asians even wrt their women, their women do heavy eye makeup, Korea is like a technically advanced Japan but without the grit and an overly western orientation, no religion in Korea due to Japanese destruction
- Japanese bookstores with nudity and girls next to regular stuff, mostly comics, used clothes store, Bic camera store, same with sex things right next to electronics and clothes at don quixote
- Family mart and 711 are the most popular convenience stores, they have constant brews of fish things that you can scoop into styrofoam takeout containers, individual takeout is very popular here including delivery
- Leg patches are prolific! So many Japanese brands, they seem to not stock many American things unlike the Koreans, who like designer stuff and american things more
- What does it take to make Japanese cities?
  - High IQ population
  - Homogeneous and hard working
  - High density to support enough economic activity
  - What else? All I know is it's impossible in America
  - Lowish wages, low prices, no rent seeking, very high efficiency (even if technology isn't used everywhere it could be, the people themselves try to be maximally efficient with their work)
