Two great guys with a good idea and a concrete plan to fulfill a real market need.

The only big questions I have are 1) how does the company plan to make enough money with $1/month fees? 2) what VC pressure will the company have to deal with? 3) is this enough of a value proposition above and beyond holding VOO or similar low-fee ETFs or low-fee mutual funds? 4) is the mutual fund structure flexible enough to handle intra-day buy/sell? 5) payment for order flow will be a pressure applied to this company eventually, is is really OK to give in or are there real reservations here? 6) roboadvisors (wealthfront, etc.) also capture a significant portion of this market need, if your value proposition is mostly cost oriented, you need ways to prevent bloating of this company and a reliance on pure low-tech solutions (avoid bloating into other markets, e.g. crypto and so forth, which require more labor which raises fees, and so forth until the cost argument falls flat)?

In general, it seems like all of these guys are just building derivatives on top of a commercial banking account and a commercial brokerage account. Who actually does the auditing here? Why aren't the APIs for consumers to do this using a single click available? In principle, partial derivative products should be doable. Why haven't any of these DeFi things actually panned out? Bridging the real world and the tokenized world seems to be a real problem with no clear solution that avoids again getting trapped in the regulatory minefield these companies wish to escape in the first place.

Will USDT actually collapse? Why haven't stablecoins become viable yet?

Is on-chain insurance (for real life assets and situations) practical? I do understand that the whole purpose behind that would be to subvert government regulations that prevent accurate insurance pricing and risk evaluation. For the case of health insurance, this should be doable, but what would it take? It would certainly be illegal. But some people are able to form religious insurance pools - is religion the escape hatch in America that permits risk discrimination?
