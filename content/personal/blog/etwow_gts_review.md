The E TWO-W GT Sport (GTS) is the only scooter in its class

- Under 30 lbs
- Under $1000
- Ultra compact (can easily fit under a Caltrain seat)
- Designed to be carried
- At least 15 miles of real-world range
- Powerful motor with good hill climbing ability

Other contenders are the NIQ Air (carbon fiber frame) and VMAX VX5 Pro

- Narrow wheels
  - BE CAREFUL! Don't get stuck in a ridge or you will lose balance.
- Wet roads / water.
  - Active rain = avoid
  - Otherwise, just go slowly and don't accelerate hard over water or brake hard - normal spinout concerns just like with a car
- Front wheel spinouts
  - This is real. You need to shift weight properly.
  - Why did they choose FWD? There is a good reason! Weight balance when carrying
- Need for body posturing and weight shifting
- eBrake is very good, don't even need the drum brake or the stomp brake but both are there for emergencies
- Battery life is excellent, charge once every 3 days (roughly 5 miles roundtrip per day). Ends around 20% battery when I charge.
- There is a minimum weight! Around 130 lbs. Not ideal for women really, weight is needed.
- Maximum height! Not good for taller riders.
- There is no fan on the charger. It is very quiet and finishes quickly (overnight is easy).
- GT vs GTS.
- L3 power only! Don't exceed 15 mph on the regular roads, only on private roads for fun only. You need the ability to run off the scooter in an emergency.
