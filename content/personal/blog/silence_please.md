# Constant Stimulus is The Worst Aspect of Modernity

- I think some ideas from here were found in Newport's Deep Work
  - Boredom is crucial to the ability to work with focus + the ability to come up with new ideas
  - Boredom brings existence to creativity and imagination
  - Stimulus does the opposite. The modern world is that of constant distraction and stimulus that prevents deep work and thinking. All thinking therefore becomes surface level.
  - Games, the instinct to scroll on Twitter/Reddit/Youtube/IG/TikTok and so forth are unavoidable for most people in the modern age with a smartphone or laptop.
  - The inability to sit bored is the root cause of lack of creativity and is the at the root of anxiety. Absent constant stimulus, you will want to do things: creative things.
  - People can't stand in line, patience is gone. As soon as any 'break' is offered in life, where there is the opportunity for boredom, people will substitute stimulus right away. The mind can't be silent without any stimulus! I even would consider reading stimulus - can you just not *do anything*?
- Have you noticed that normies can't live without constant stimulation?
  - Things began to get off the rails, especially after the introduction of Airpods.
  - Music everywhere. Forget the constant speakerphone and bluetooth speaker noise that exists in all urban and even suburban areas, "music" is present everywhere.
    - The inability to enjoy music on its own as an exclusive activity. Only concerts offer this experience nowdays and people don't want a part of it - and it costs a lot too.
    - "the background soundtrack to my life", give me a break.
  - Tiktok/Youtube shorts/IG videos where two videos are side-by-side, minecraft on one side, video on the other side, text appears in the middle of the screen, narration in the typical AI voice. Zoomers can't even pay attention to a single stream video anymore. There are

> People often complain about kids not reading, but it's actually incredible how illiterate Boomers are. As soon as they encounter the written word, their brain plays the Windows XP shutdown sound and nothing gets through. If it isn't verbalized (e.g., TV), they can't understand.
>
> Some of it can be attributed to senility, especially considering how old the workforce is getting. Don't expect anything longer than a single full sentence to be comprehended.
>
> I'm sort of the opposite, in that I place zero value on anything someone says. If it's not written down, it's meaningless. There's too many liars and crooks nowadays to believe otherwise.

> It seems we're reverting to an oral culture at large, as the United States transforms--demographically, but also economically, socially, and even spiritually--into a South Asian bazaar. The video essay and the podcast replacing the blog and forum are symptomatic of this.

> obsession with pro-noise cancellation and silence/headphones/no talking on speakerphone, watching videos etc in public is surely a fascist cultural victory. a sign of dark times ahead
>
> > Why do “anti-fascists” do the most to associate everything good with fascism? Clean public spaces, contemplative silence, mutual respect between citizens, beauty, fitness, health. I’ve seen every one of these things labeled “fascism.” This is a losing political strategy

Good times are coming.

> I have seen a continual worsening of Indian society. Whatever grace and civility Christian missionaries and European colonizers instilled in Indians has been slowly eroding.
>
> I distinctly recall my first day outside of India. On a train trip from Heathrow Airport to Manchester, I saw what I initially thought were dull-looking houses and clean, unremarkable waterways and air. The lack of hustle and bustle and the calmness of the train ride left me feeling disoriented and gloomy. I didn’t know how to cope with a situation where there was no constant assault on my senses.
>
> With time, I realized that for most Indian immigrants, this led to a compulsive need to recreate India in the ghettos they moved into. They sought the familiar smells, noise, and constant hustle and bustle. They recreated never-ending emotionalism, fruitless conflicts, chaos, and intellectual inbreeding.

This phenomena is visible in both the UK and Canada but America has thankfully escaped this fate (for now, and in general, it probably applies to high alien density areas).
