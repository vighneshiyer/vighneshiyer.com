# Constant Stimulus is The Worst Aspect of Modernity

- I think some ideas from here were found in Newport's Deep Work
  - Boredom is crucial to the ability to work with focus + the ability to come up with new ideas
  - Boredom brings existence to creativity and imagination
  - Stimulus does the opposite. The modern world is that of constant distraction and stimulus that prevents deep work and thinking. All thinking therefore becomes surface level.
  - Games, the instinct to scroll on Twitter/Reddit/Youtube/IG/TikTok and so forth are unavoidable for most people in the modern age with a smartphone or laptop.
  - The inability to sit bored is the root cause of lack of creativity and is the at the root of anxiety. Absent constant stimulus, you will want to do things: creative things.
  - People can't stand in line, patience is gone. As soon as any 'break' is offered in life, where there is the opportunity for boredom, people will substitute stimulus right away. The mind can't be silent without any stimulus! I even would consider reading stimulus - can you just not *do anything*?
- Have you noticed that normies can't live without constant stimulation?
  - Things began to get off the rails during the introduction of Airpods.
  - Music everywhere. Forget the constant speakerphone and bluetooth speaker noise that exists in all urban and even suburban areas, "music" is present everywhere.
    - The inability to enjoy music on its own as an exclusive activity. Only concerts offer this experience nowdays and people don't want a part of it - and it costs a lot too.
    - "the background soundtrack to my life", give me a break.
  - Tiktok/Youtube shorts/IG videos where two videos are side-by-side, minecraft on one side, video on the other side, text appears in the middle of the screen, narration in the typical AI voice. Zoomers can't even pay attention to a single stream video anymore.
- What about 3rd world people?
