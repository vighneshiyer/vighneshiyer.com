# Constant Stimulus is The Worst Aspect of Modernity

- I think some ideas from here were found in Newport's Deep Work
  - Boredom is crucial to the ability to work with focus + the ability to come up with new ideas
  - Boredom brings existence to creativity and imagination
  - Stimulus does the opposite. The modern world is that of constant distraction and stimulus that prevents deep work and thinking. All thinking therefore becomes surface level.
  - Games, the instinct to scroll on Twitter/Reddit/Youtube/IG/TikTok and so forth are unavoidable for most people in the modern age with a smartphone or laptop.
  - The inability to sit bored is the root cause of lack of creativity and is the at the root of anxiety. Absent constant stimulus, you will want to do things: creative things.
  - People can't stand in line, patience is gone. As soon as any 'break' is offered in life, where there is the opportunity for boredom, people will substitute stimulus right away. The mind can't be silent without any stimulus! I even would consider reading stimulus - can you just not *do anything*?
- Have you noticed that normies can't live without constant stimulation?
  - Things began to get off the rails, especially after the introduction of Airpods.
  - Music everywhere. Forget the constant speakerphone and bluetooth speaker noise that exists in all urban and even suburban areas, "music" is present everywhere.
    - The inability to enjoy music on its own as an exclusive activity. Only concerts offer this experience nowdays and people don't want a part of it - and it costs a lot too.
    - "the background soundtrack to my life", give me a break.
  - Tiktok/Youtube shorts/IG videos where two videos are side-by-side, minecraft on one side, video on the other side, text appears in the middle of the screen, narration in the typical AI voice. Zoomers can't even pay attention to a single stream video anymore. There are

> People often complain about kids not reading, but it's actually incredible how illiterate Boomers are. As soon as they encounter the written word, their brain plays the Windows XP shutdown sound and nothing gets through. If it isn't verbalized (e.g., TV), they can't understand.
>
> Some of it can be attributed to senility, especially considering how old the workforce is getting. Don't expect anything longer than a single full sentence to be comprehended.
>
> I'm sort of the opposite, in that I place zero value on anything someone says. If it's not written down, it's meaningless. There's too many liars and crooks nowadays to believe otherwise.
>
> It seems we're reverting to an oral culture at large, as the United States transforms--demographically, but also economically, socially, and even spiritually--into a South Asian bazaar. The video essay and the podcast replacing the blog and forum are symptomatic of this.

> obsession with pro-noise cancellation and silence/headphones/no talking on speakerphone, watching videos etc in public is surely a fascist cultural victory. a sign of dark times ahead
>
> > Why do “anti-fascists” do the most to associate everything good with fascism? Clean public spaces, contemplative silence, mutual respect between citizens, beauty, fitness, health. I’ve seen every one of these things labeled “fascism.” This is a losing political strategy

Good times are coming.

> I have seen a continual worsening of Indian society. Whatever grace and civility Christian missionaries and European colonizers instilled in Indians has been slowly eroding.
>
> I distinctly recall my first day outside of India. On a train trip from Heathrow Airport to Manchester, I saw what I initially thought were dull-looking houses and clean, unremarkable waterways and air. The lack of hustle and bustle and the calmness of the train ride left me feeling disoriented and gloomy. I didn’t know how to cope with a situation where there was no constant assault on my senses.
>
> With time, I realized that for most Indian immigrants, this led to a compulsive need to recreate India in the ghettos they moved into. They sought the familiar smells, noise, and constant hustle and bustle. They recreated never-ending emotionalism, fruitless conflicts, chaos, and intellectual inbreeding.

This phenomena is visible in both the UK and Canada but America has thankfully escaped this fate (for now, and in general, it probably applies to high alien density areas).

  - Quite a good article and discussion about the importance of boredom via lack of continuous and easily available external stimulation

- GPT on noise: https://chatgpt.com/share/681a9eb6-9910-8004-9826-0ea397186feb
  - Futurism noise music: The Art of Noises by Luigi Russolo
  - Schopenhauer: On Noise (his particular dislike for whips, perhaps he would have similar feelings towards leafblowers)
  - John Cage's 4'33" - avant-garde take on ambient noise, not so relevant though, the guy seems like a subversive too

> Greek Philosophy: Schole and Contemplative Leisure
>
> In ancient Greece, the term scholē (σχολή) denoted leisure, but not idleness. It referred to time dedicated to learning, contemplation, and philosophical discourse. This concept laid the foundation for the word "school," emphasizing that true education arises from unhurried reflection.
> Wikipedia
>
> Democritus, known as the "laughing philosopher," valued euthymia—a state of contented tranquility. He believed that such peace of mind was achieved through moderation, self-awareness, and philosophical inquiry, rather than through constant activity or external stimulation.
> Wikipedia
> Roman Philosophy: Otium and the Value of Solitude
>
> The Romans embraced otium, a form of dignified leisure allowing for intellectual and spiritual pursuits. Cicero and Seneca viewed otium as essential for philosophical contemplation and personal growth. Seneca, in his letters, emphasized that true leisure is not mere inactivity but a state wherein the mind engages in meaningful thought, free from the distractions of public life.

Now we're getting somewhere. How could such concepts have been developed and defined in Ancient times but nothing new came of these in the 2000 years following? They discovered the truth, and nothing was left.
In contrast, the commentary about noise and leisure from Chinese philosophy is so weak and uninspiring (see the GPT chat). The Japanese seem to have better insights at least. The analysis of Hindu philosophy seems weak.

- Grok on noise: https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_3f527d73-84d1-45a0-a906-43a2eff72de2
  - I found Grok's search results to be less interesting than GPT's for this query
  - This https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sounds/ isn't as relevant as I would have expected
  - It seems no one put it better than Schopenhauer'
  - In general, Grok has produced too many meaningless words and is just rephrasing the prompt over and over again

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia
  - Perhaps I suffer from this mental issue. This seems quite common actually. There are many sounds that I find very irritating besides the jarring nosies that Schopenhauer also finds the same way. Conversation can be bad. Breathing is quite annoying - I hate sounds of breathing by others who always seem to be forcing air through their nose and mouth. Keyboard noise is quite bad, I like a very quiet keyboard and hearing others bang on keys is quite annoying. Indeed these all are mentioned as sounds that people with misophonia hate.
  - There seems to be relationship between this issue and high fluid intelligence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence). Schopenhauer would agree lol.

> My sleep scores during recent travel were in the 90s. Now back in SF I am consistently back down to 70s, 80s.
>
> I am increasingly convinced that this is due to traffic noise from a nearby road/intersection where I live - every ~10min, a car, truck, bus, or motorcycle with a very loud engine passes by (some are 10X louder than others). In the later less deep stages of sleep, it is much easier to wake and then much harder to go back to sleep.
>
> More generally I think noise pollution (esp early hours) come at a huge societal cost that is not correctly accounted for. E.g. I wouldn't be too surprised if a single motorcycle riding through a neighborhood at 6am creates millions of dollars in damages in the form of hundreds - thousands of people who are more groggy, more moody, less creative, less energetic for the whole day, and more sick in the long term (cardiovascular, metabolic, cognitive). And I think that many people, like me, might not be aware that this happening for a long time because 1) they don't measure their sleep carefully, and 2) your brain isn't fully conscious when waking and isn't able to make a lasting note / association in that state. I really wish future versions of Whoop (or Oura or etc.) would explicitly track and correlate noise to sleep, and raise this to the population.
>
> It's not just traffic, e.g. in SF, as a I recently found out, it is ok by law to begin arbitrarily loud road work or construction starting 7am. Same for leaf blowers and a number of other ways of getting up to 100dB.
>
> I ran a few Deep Research sessions and a number of studies that have tried to isolate noise and show depressing outcomes for cohorts of people who sleep in noisy environments, with increased risk across all of mental health (e.g. depression, bipolar disorders, Alzheimer's incidence) but also a lot more broadly, e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes.
>
> Anyway, it took me a while to notice and after (unsuccessfully) trying a number of mitigations I am moving somewhere quiet. But from what I've seen this is a major public health issue with little awareness and with incorrect accounting by the government.
