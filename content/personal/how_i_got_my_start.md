Very early on, got a thinkpad to play with from my dad after he finished his MBA. I think this was sometime in early middle school, around 7th grade.
installing many random linux distros, it's free!
damn small linux, ps3 yellow dog linux
ubuntu, xubuntu, manjaro, slackware, fedora, dual booting
geeks2go windows help forum, windows registry, IT-related stuff
library books, html/css, basic
asm programming from scratch
failure to learn C
modx, php, laravel, angularjs, react, javascript / typescript, ES6, jquery
first job
css, framework
playing with python
first internship, ios programming with objc + backend
java backend and frontend webdev, second internship
more CS courses, OS knowledge
introduction to digital design
switching into verification and circuit design
more circuits focus suddenly, wanted to apply cs techniques, but was thwarted, circuits is quite intuition-oriented, i felt unprepared and not capable
applied into grad school for circuits
nvidia internship
systemc
scala and chisel
move away from circuits into digital verification
move away from verification into simulation methodology and uarch
now i'm here today

important note: everything was organic, nothing was forced, zero input from my parents or other peers
i believe the path i followed is pretty typical for those with intrinsic interest. this is why i'm skeptical when people think 'resources' or 'encouragement' or otherwise is a missing piece to 'get' people 'into' CS. seems like BS
tutoring experience, intrinsic ability and interest in key! parenting makes basically zero difference beyond a basic level. beyond that it is pushing intrinsic interests to the pinnacle - that is where there is still tons of deficiency. focusing on random college nonsense instead of pursuing what is in the blood.
