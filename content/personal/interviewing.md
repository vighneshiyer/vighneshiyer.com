title = "My 'Discriminatory' Approach to Interviewing"
date = 2024-05-06
+++

My approach to interviewing undergrads (and others). Proven over many years of working with exceptional undergrads.

## Important Things

- Natural curiosity
- Hacker mentality
- Desire to write, explain, and teach for fun
- Broad scope of interests, generalist
- Strong programmer
- **Intrinsic** (in the blood) interest in computer science topics

## Irrelevant Things

- Classes you've taken and coursework
- GPA
- Your background on any given research topic

## My Approach

1. Show me your editor
  - Open a random project (anything is fine, class project, personal thing, random open source codebase) and go through it
  - What do you like about your editor? Show off your favorite things it can do.
  - What are things you've done to customize your editor? Why do you think the defaults are bad or insufficient?
1. Show me your desktop environment (or terminal multiplexer or anything in a similar vein)
  - How do you organize your workspace?
  - Do you like having many tasks going on at the same time and switching between them or focusing on a singular task at a time? (there is no right answer, I just want to hear a strongly held opinion)
1. Have you written any tiny scripts to make common tasks easier?
  - This can literally be anything. I even consider bash aliases to be 'tiny scripts'. I'm looking for any instinct towards automation and workflow optimization (and curiosity).
1. Show me something you've played around with recently for fun.
  - This can be anything. A new programming language, an IDE, a library, a random program, a game, or some art. It doesn't have to be related to CS in any way: a new language, some physical skill, exercise, cooking, whatever!
1. What are a few interesting things you read recently? Do they motivate any work?
1. What problems in any field of your choice do you think are worth solving and you could attack? How would you start?

Anyone in the know can attest that asking these things and getting meaningful responses gives you high confidence in the person's ability to do research *in any area*.
Asking random leetcode nonsense, 'behavioral' questions, info about coursework projects, and random chit-chat doesn't correlate with anything.
Finally, this is a two-way street: the candidate must also be interested in working with you and on your set of projects, so you must prove you can help them achieve their goals when seeking out research.
