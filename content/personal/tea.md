## Gongfu

[Gongfu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea) is a Chinese tea brewing methodology that incorporates many infusion cycles and small brewing volumes to explore the many slices of flavors in a single tea.

### Equipment

It is recommended that you purchase each piece separately rather than buying a set to work your way into all the equipment.
However, sets are also nice, especially when they are aesthetically consistent and beautiful.

#### Must Haves

- Loose leaf tea
  - The tea itself! Although you can brew tea from a bag or with a strainer, one purpose of Gongfu is to let whole tea leaves open up and spread their flavor
- Tea cups
  - Gongfu cups usually hold 50-100 ml
  - They are usually filled with 50 ml of tea at a time
- [Gaiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaiwan)
  - This is the main brewing vessel where the tea is extracted
  - [Typical volume](https://www.reddit.com/r/GongFuTea/comments/18z09qt/best_size_for_gaiwan/) for a gaiwan is 100-150 ml although much larger ones are available. Small gaiwans around 50-75 ml are available for solo brewing too.
  - Rule of thumb: ~40-50 ml of tea per cup. So for serving 3/4 people at a time, use a 150 ml gaiwan. Larger gaiwans are uncommon, so if serving an even larger crowd, you should accumulate multiple gaiwan brewings in a larger kettle and then pour them into cups all at once.
- Filter
  - A [fine mesh filter](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/copy-of-buy-it-for-life-stainless-steel-tea-filter-large) placed on top of the fairness kettle or tea cups will strain away sediments

#### Nice-to-Haves

- Fairness kettle
  - After brewing tea in the gaiwan, it is poured into this kettle so you can immediately begin brewing the next infusion in the gaiwan
  - A fairness kettle also helps with even distribution of the brewed tea into the tea cups
  - It also allows you to combine several brews before serving if you're using a small gaiwan
- [Tea tray]()
- Tea scoop
- [Tea tongs](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/bamboo-sliver-tea-tongs)
- Tea storage

#### Completing a Set

- [Tea boat](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/celadon-cherry-blossom-tea-boat-1)
- Tea pet
- [Tea pick/needle](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/cigarillo-tea-needle-light-wood)
  - For compressed tea cakes
  - For unclogging a teapot spout
