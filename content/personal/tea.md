## Gongfu

[Gongfu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea) is a Chinese tea brewing methodology that incorporates many infusion cycles and small brewing volumes to explore the many slices of flavors in a single tea.

### Equipment

It is recommended that you purchase each piece separately rather than buying a set to work your way into all the equipment.
However, sets are also nice, especially when they are aesthetically consistent and beautiful.
I've included links to examples of these equipments.

#### Must Haves

Loose leaf tea ([example](https://yunnansourcing.us/collections/curated-tea-samplers/products/starter-pack))
: The tea itself! Although you can brew tea from a bag or with a strainer, one purpose of Gongfu is to let whole tea leaves open up and spread their flavor

Tea cups ([example](https://yunnansourcing.us/collections/cups/products/desert-and-sky-glazed-ceramic-gaiwan-and-cups?variant=35434050846879))
: Gongfu cups usually hold 50-100 ml. They are usually filled with 50 ml of tea at a time

Gaiwan ([example](https://yunnansourcing.us/collections/gaiwans/products/bamboo-motif-jingdezhen-porcelain-gaiwan))
: [A gaiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaiwan) is the main brewing vessel where the tea is extracted.
The [typical volume for a gaiwan](https://www.reddit.com/r/GongFuTea/comments/18z09qt/best_size_for_gaiwan/) is 100-150 ml although much larger ones are available.
Small gaiwans around 50-75 ml are available for solo brewing too.
Rule of thumb: ~40-50 ml of tea per cup. So for serving 3/4 people at a time, use a 150 ml gaiwan. Larger gaiwans are uncommon, so if serving an even larger crowd, you should accumulate multiple gaiwan brewings in a larger kettle and then pour them into cups all at once.

Filter ([example](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/copy-of-buy-it-for-life-stainless-steel-tea-filter-large))
: A fine mesh filter placed on top of the fairness kettle or tea cups to strain away sediments

Kettle
: Some way to boil water (ideally with fine temperature control).

#### Nice-to-Haves

- Fairness kettle ([example](https://yunnansourcing.us/collections/cha-hai/products/wood-fired-kiln-cu-tao-clay-cha-hai))
  - After brewing tea in the gaiwan, it is poured into this kettle so you can immediately begin brewing the next infusion in the gaiwan
  - A fairness kettle also helps with even distribution of the brewed tea into the tea cups
  - It allows you to combine several brews before serving if you're using a small gaiwan
- Tea tray ([example](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/black-cover-bamboo-tea-tray))
  - Since brews are discarded in the prep for gongfu, a tea tray provides a basin that collects the discarded water
- Tea scoop ([example]())
  - An ornamental scoop to measure and transfer tea from storage to the gaiwan
- Tea tongs ([example](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/bamboo-sliver-tea-tongs))
  - It is nice to use tongs to invert tea cups on the tea tray to discard water used for preheating and tea leaf washing

#### Completing a Set

- Tea storage ([example](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/red-jun-yao-porcelain-tea-jar))
  - A pot to store tea leaves after opening any packaging
- Tea boat / presentation vessel ([example](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/celadon-cherry-blossom-tea-boat-1), [example](https://yunnansourcing.us/collections/cha-he-presentation-vessels/products/white-porcelain-classic-cha-he-presentation-vessel))
  - A small open vessel used to show tea leaves to guests and to load the gaiwan with tea
- Tea pet ([example](https://yunnansourcing.com/collections/tea-mascots/products/yixing-purple-clay-ox-tea-mascot))
  - A clay figurine to pour discarded water and brews over
- Tea pick/needle ([example](https://teaware.house/collections/tools-and-tea-accessories/products/cigarillo-tea-needle-light-wood), [example](https://yunnansourcing.us/collections/picks-and-pryers-for-taking-apart-pu-erh-cakes/products/sandalwood-pick-for-prying-apart-pu-erh-tea-cakes))
  - For picking apart compressed Pu'er tea cakes or for unclogging a teapot spout
- Even more things: tea basin for spent tea leaves, digital scale for weighing tea, a timer for measuring brew times, an aroma cup, a brush for spreading tea liquid over the tea tray evenly

### Setting the Environment

To me it seems that gongfu is best enjoyed in a small room with floor seating.
A cool open breeze is ideal.
Lighting some incense is also a good idea.
Playing some light instrumental music might be good too.
