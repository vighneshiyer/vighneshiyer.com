- Lots to say here, nearly everything is different and eye opening
- Literally from the eye opening - in typically taught 'Hindu' meditation, eyes closed is the norm. Not the case with Zazen! Eyes must be only half-closed! You need to be aware of your environment - take in the sight, but reduce the stimulus.
- Posture - erect spine, full lotus, on the floor VS curved spine, belly forward, full lotus only if possible, on a zabuton on top of a zafu
- Focus: draw to the breath first, walking meditation
- Mudra: cosmic vs gyan
- Nearly everything about the methodology of meditation is different. Crazy how I have ignored the Zen traditional all this time and haven't realized how different it is.
- Zazen - emphasis on incrementalism on every level from day 1 to mastery.
- Focus point: right in front of you through half-open eyes VS third eye
- Commonalities: group meditation as a power source
