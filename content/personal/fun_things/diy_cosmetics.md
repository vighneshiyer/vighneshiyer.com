I'm a bit frustrated buying products that I have no faith in.
At the same time, I'm annoyed at my personal lack of knowledge about cosmetics and their ingredients.
Finally, trying to stick with 'natural' products is clearly suboptimal - relying on some 'chemicals' and concentrates produced by industrial processes has some advantages.

The cosmetics under question:

- Deodorant
- Body Soap
- Shampoo
- Conditioner
- Leave in conditioner / hair oil (avoiding excess oiliness is key)
- Toothpaste
- Body + face lotion / cream (heavy, but not oily, to moisturize)
- Body oil / lotion bar (oily and light, to seal skin)
- Protectant (thick petroleum for lips and cuts)

- Discussion on preservatives is interesting
  - Pure oil products don't need any preservatives
  - Water oil emulsions need a preservative - this is critical, something I thought I would just not care about, but it seems bacteria and mold will grow for sure

> the ideal proportion for ceramides, cholesterol, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid is 3:1:1:1 – but it doesn’t matter which one is the 3. As long as there’s 3 parts of one ingredient to 1 part of each of the other three, moisture barrier repair goes through the damn roof.
