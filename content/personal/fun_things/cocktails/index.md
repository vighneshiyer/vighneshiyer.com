Making cocktails at home is good because:

1. You can customize them to your or your guests' liking
2. You can make cocktails with high-end liquors that you pick out
3. You can enjoy drinking in your own quiet space
4. Bartending at home is cost effective

I am by no means an expert on this topic but here is what I've learned so far.

## Specs

These aren't the "true" "official" recipes, but rather my own hacked together versions that I like.

<!--
A sticker with a white border, no backdrop or shadow, and a white background. High resolution. Sketchy, cartoon-like style.

Whiskey: The sticker should be a bottle of whiskey modeled after the Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon bottle.
Simple syrup: The sticker should be a glass bottle of clear simple syrup with a label. Just use the words 'Simple Syrup' with perhaps a flourish. Use a glass bottle with a tight metal clasp and rubber gasket (a flip-top metal clasp).
Plus: The sticker should be a thick black solid plus (+) sign. Keep the sign no larger than 50% of the vertical and horizontal space you have to work with.
Angostura bitters: The sticker should be a bottle of Angostura bitters. Use the classic design. Reference how it looks via image search.
Orange bitters: The sticker should be a bottle of Angostura orange bitters. Use the classic design. Reference how it looks via image search.
Right arrow: The sticker should be a thick black right arrow (->) sign. Keep the sign no larger than 50% of the vertical and horizontal space you have to work with.
Mixing glass: The sticker should be a cocktail mixing glass that's filled halfway with cubed ice, with a barspoon angled inside the mixing glass.
Equals: The sticker should be a thick black equals (=) sign. Keep the sign no larger than 50% of the vertical and horizontal space you have to work with.
Lemonade: The sticker should be a glass bottle of lemonade with a label and flourish.
Lemon: The sticker should be a single lemon.
Shaker: The sticker should be a cobbler shaker for cocktails.

Old Fashioned: The sticker should be an Old Fashioned cocktail inside a rocks glass with a gridded glass pattern. The rocks glass should contain one large ice cube and a garnish of an orange peel, twisted and one-half placed in the glass, with the rest hanging on the rim.
I want the orange peel to be on the rim. I want the rocks glass to have vertical sides And I want the ice cube to be as large as the glass diameter.
-->

### Old Fashioned

There are many variations and you can use any spirit, although whiskey is the classic.

### Japanese Snow Monkey

I had [this cocktail](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1IcTPbRGz3/?hl=en) at Rumba.
The spec is given as: "Kiyomi rum, Nigori sake, Bermutto dry vermouth, Campari, raspberry, and lemon".
"A floral but punchy take on a Negroni to help brighten long winter days."
There was a particular roasted corn-like and slightly smoky flavor that was hard to pin down, but was very good.
My attempted reproduction:

Ingredients
: - 1oz Japanese rum (or 3/4oz white rum + 1/4oz agricole blanc)
  - 1oz Nigori sake
  - 3/4oz dry vermouth
  - 1/2oz Campari

  - 1/2oz lemon juice
  - Sprinkle of salt
  - 3-4 drops of mezcal (for slight smoke)

Method
: Muddle raspberries. Shake with ice. Double strain.

Serving and Garnish
: Coupe, up.

Good Bottles
: Probitas (for rum). Tozai Snow Maiden, Sho Chiku Bai Nigori (for sake).

## Poison Reviews

Here are things I've tried and what I think.
*To be clear*: I have no actual taste in alcohol.
Total amateur opinions to follow.

### Whiskey

- *Maker's Mark 46*. (6/10). I like it. Good enough neat.
- *Woodford Reserve (Regular)*. (4/10). Pretty good, but I prefer Maker's 46 over this. Not so great anymore after having better whiskeys.
- *Suntory Toki*. (6/10). I really like it when mixed. Ideal for highballs and sours. Not great neat.
- *Four Roses Small Batch*. (8/10). The best so far. Excellent. Very smooth and flavorful. Very enjoyable neat. Spending more on bourbon (at least $40 for a 750ml bottle) seems to be worth it.
- *Redbreast 12*. TBD.
- *Michter's US1*. TBD.

### Rum

- *Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva*. (7/10). I like it. A few feel it is too harsh and doesn't go down smooth, at least neat. But I'm a fan.
- *Appleton Estate 8*. TBD.

### Soju

- *Hwayo 25 Soju*. (5/10). Has an initial taste much closer to sake than soju, but still inferior to sake. Good to try, but the aftertaste is still too alcoholic.
- *Ilpoom Jinro Oak 43 Soju*. TBD.

### Gin

- *Citadelle Gin*. (9/10). Excellent 'celery'-like + juniper berry flavor, freshness as the final note. Gimlet with this is too good.
- *Hendrick's Gin.* (8/10). Also very good, but more subtle finish and harsher down the throat vs Citadelle

### Wines

- Port
  - *Porto Morgado Old Tawny (10 Years)*. (7/10). Sits around $10 from Trader Joe's. Hits way way above its price point. We love this.
  - *Porto Morgado Ruby*. (5/10). Not as good. Similar price point, but much worse than above imo.
  - *Fairbanks Cellars California Port (1.5L)*. (2/10). Cheap but bad. Stay away.
  - *Warre's Otima 10 Tawny Porto*. TBD.
- Reds
  - *Decoy Cabernet*. (5/10). Decent, hits a bit above its price point, but it's better to spend more.
  - *Sean Thackrey Pleiades XXXII*. (9/10) Very good. Fruity and smooth.
  - *Charles Shaw wines (all varieties)*. (3/10). Very cheap, but do not buy lol. Get something nicer.
  - *No Es Pituko Carignan 2024*. (8/10). So so smooth, hard to believe there was any alcohol at all. Excellent.
  - *Chateau Pey-Bonhomme Le-Tours Merlot*. TBD.
  - *Folk Machine Pinot Noir*. TBD.
  - *Love Red 2022 - Broc Cellars*. TBD.
- Whites
  - *2021 Virgo Magic Wines 'Disco Lemonade' Riesling*. (5/10). Tastes heavily like brined olives. I think this is an acquired taste, not for a general audience.
  - *Barefoot Moscato*. (2/10). Cheap, mild tasting, and gulpable. Get something nicer.
  - *Risata Moscato d'Asti DOCG*. (8/10). Low alcohol, smooth, sweet, and fruity. A crowd favorite.
  - *2023 Nickel & Nickel Grand Sky Vineyard Chardonnay*. (9/10) Incredibly good, smooth, bright lime aftertaste.
- Orange
  - *2023 Suisun Valley Assyrtiko, Hydrangea Skin-Contact*. (8/10). Excellent.
  - *Pielihueso Naranjo 2024*. (9/10). Very very good. Smooth, slightly fruity, and crisp. Best served cold.
  - *2023 Gulp Hablo Orange (1L)*. TBD.

### Meads

- The [Remeadies](https://www.remeadies.com/) meadery near Sequoia National Park is very good. Go there if nearby. Unfortunately, their meads aren't easily available in NorCal.
- *Chaucer's Mead*. (6/10). Very vanilla alcoholic honey flavor, smooth. Nothing objectionable, but nothing special either. Good for the price.
- *Sky River Sweet Mead*. (7/10). At $30 it is expensive for what it is. Much more complex mead with a barnyard / wet grass flavor and floral notes. Not appreciated by everyone.

### Sake

[Takara Sake](https://www.takarasake.com) has a sake factory in Berkeley, CA!
I highly recommend visiting them and doing a tasting.
What follows are all sakes from Takara (some brewed in Berkeley, others in Japan).

- *Sho Chiku Bai REI Junmai Daiginjo*. (8/10). One of our favorites. Cheap and good, serve chilled, crisp, fruity, and smooth. If it is too old, it will acquire a mushroom-y flavor.
- *Sho Chiku Bai Organic Nama*. (6/10). Good chilled, but has an earthy flavor. Not suitable for a general audience.
- *Sho Chiku Bai Takara Sierra Cold*. (7/10). This is an insane sake. Serve chilled. 12% ABV but tastes like zero! Very light flavor of slight sweetness and fruit, but mostly tasteless.
- *Sho Chiku Bai Nigori Crème de Sake*. (9/10). Cream sake! One of our favorites. Serve chilled. Flavor is both fruity and earthy, more on the sweet side.

### Cocktail Liquors

- *Dolin Rouge (Sweet) Vermouth*. Decent, I have no comparison point.
- *Cointreau*. It works, I have no reference point for orange liqueur.
- *Baileys*. Sweet, smooth, milky. Nothing bad, but nothing great either.
- *Mr. Black Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur*. Decent, good espresso flavor.
- *TJ's Limoncello*. TBD.

### Garnishes

- *Luxadro cherries*. TBD. These are so expensive, it better be worth it.
  - Totally worth it. So delicious and the syrup is great to add to a cocktail.
- *Angostura bitters*. It is what it is, pretty good &mdash; not many other options.

## Equipment

First, there is some basic equipment that you need, that I wish I had from the start.
Just buy these things.

- *Large ice cube tray*: I liked these Tovolo "King Cube" silicon trays ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXF6H2Y))
- *Regular ice cube tray*: I bought some "no-spill" trays from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007U256D2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1))
- *Jigger*: There are 2 major varieties (double-ended and angled). You need to be able to measure volumes from 1/4oz to 2oz. I think the angled jiggers are way easier to use at home with less spillage than the double-ended kind. I like this one from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B6LUAPW)).
- *Rocks Glasses*: Of course you need glasses to serve cocktails in. Of all the varieties, I find [rocks glasses](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_glass) to be the most versatile, albeit not the prettiest. I bought these ones from Anchor Hocking ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BC3MI5O)). [Coupes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_glass#Coupe) or [nick and noras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_%26_Nora_(glass)) would be good next additions.
- *Citrus juicer*: These are cheap, just get any one. I want to try the Barfly Large Manual Juicer sometime ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Barfly-Large-Manual-Juicer-Aluminum/dp/B0B14PYCRF))
- *Mixing tin*: There are also cocktail mixing glasses, but I prefer a stainless steel mixing vessel. I have this one from American Metalcraft ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QQQGTWY)).
- *Hawthorne Strainer*: This OXO one is good ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DAQ93))
- *Cobbler shaker*: There are also Boston shakers, but a cobbler shaker is far easier to use at home. I got this one from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JW89TC3)). If I was OK spending $60 on this, I would buy the [YETI one](https://www.yeti.com/drinkware/barware/cocktail-shaker-20oz.html).
- *Fine mesh strainer*: I have a 3" strainer from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-3-Inch-Strainer-Multicolor/dp/B001713L84))
- *Bar spoon*: Just get some cheap bar spoons, the exact model doesn't matter.
- *Corkscrew*: You need to be able to pull corks. Buy whatever is within your budget - these are all kind of the same.
- *Toothpicks*: The poor man's version of the fancy cocktail pick. Often too short to place over the rim of a glass
  - *Cocktail picks*: A substantial upgrade
- *Cooler*: I use an insulated bag to hold all my ice and cold liquors, but a proper hard-case insulated cooler would be better.

Now, there is nothing to do except chill all your mixers and liquors.
Since all the cocktails I like are served chilled, I even chill the liquors that aren't typically chilled (whiskey, vermouth, rum, soju).
