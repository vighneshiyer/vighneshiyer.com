## General-Purpose Cleaning Spray

For a 16oz bottle, measure the following quantities:

- Distilled water: 200g
- White vinegar (5% concentration): 200g
- Borax powder: 15g
- Liquid dish soap: 5g
- Lemon juice: 1/2 lemon (approx 30g)
- Lime juice: 1 lime (approx 15g)
- Tea tree oil: 5 drops
- Oregano oil: 5 drops
- Orange oil: 10 drops

Double this recipe for a 32oz bottle.
You can use whatever essential oils you have on hand, but tea tree oil is particularly nice since it is an antimicrobial.

Begin by squeezing the limes and lemons into a bowl with a strainer to catch seeds and large pulp pieces.
Then strain the juice once more through cheesecloth to catch the fine particles.

Measure 50g of water in a glass measuring cup and warm it in the microwave for 15-30 seconds until warm.
Stir in the borax until completely dissolved.

Then add the remainder of the water.
Add vinegar, dish soap, the lime and lemon juice and mix.
Add the essential oils and swirl to combine to avoid foaming.
Pour into a spray bottle.

## Deodorant

I modeled this after the Arm and Hammer Orange-Scented Aluminum-Free stick deodorant.
The main things that deodorant contains are propylene glycol (moisturizer), sodium stearate (foam booster), baking soda, essential oils (chamomile, coriander, geranium, orange) + unspecified fragrance, ethylhexylglycerin (skin conditioner), octenidine HCL (anti-bacterial, preservative), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer, preservative), and allantoin (moisturizer).
Many of these ingredients seem unnecessary though.

From looking online, here are the typical ingredients used in DIY deodorants:

- _Essential oils_: orange, lemon, almond, chamomile, tea tree, bergamot, cedarwood, lemongrass
- _Oil base_: beeswax pellets, coconut oil, shea butter (_refined_ shea butter is odorless), mango butter, vitamin E oil
- _Dry base_: baking soda (or substitute with non-nano pharmaceutical _zinc oxide_), arrowroot powder

My decision shall be:

- Essential oil: orange, tea tree, cedarwood
- Oil base: beeswax, mango butter, coconut oil
- Dry base: baking soda, arrowroot powder


And now the [recipe](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68894e4a587881918756333e899bdb85) (courtesy of GPT):

| Ingredient               | Weight            | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Coconut oil              | 100 g             | Soft base, antimicrobial         |
| Mango butter             | 70 g              | Moisturizing carrier butter      |
| Beeswax (pellets)        | 20 g              | Structure; keeps semi‑solid      |
| Baking soda              | 40 g              | Odor neutralizer (≈14%)          |
| Arrowroot powder         | 40 g              | Absorbency, smooth texture       |
| Sweet orange EO          | 40 drops (\~1 mL) | Bright citrus scent              |
| Tea tree EO              | 10 drops          | Antibacterial, fresh herbal note |
| Cedarwood EO             | 5 drops           | Warm, woodsy base note           |
| Vitamin E oil (optional) | 5 drops           | Antioxidant, shelf-life extender |

1. Melt oils & wax
In a double boiler, melt coconut oil, mango butter, and beeswax together until smooth.

2. Mix powders
In a separate bowl, whisk together the baking soda and arrowroot powder until lump-free.

3. Combine
Remove melted oils from heat. Allow to cool briefly (~30 s), then gradually whisk in powders until completely uniform.

4. Add essential oils
Stir in sweet orange, tea tree, cedarwood, and Vitamin E if used. This keeps EO total under ~2% of final weight—safe and well within typical leave-on dilution limits.

5. Jar it
Pour the mixture into your 10oz glass jar. Leave uncovered until fully set at room temp (about 1–2 hours), then cap and store.

## Laundry

- Use a simple detergent: Persil Proclean Original, All Unscented
  - Use a small amount: 1-2 tbsp for small-large loads
  - DIY detergent TBD (I don't think it's really worth it, to be honest)
- Pretreat stains with just a little bit of detergent rubbed in. No need for any special sprays.
- Use a powdered washing booster along with detergent. Add directly to the washing machine.
  - 2 parts oxygen bleach (e.g. [Nellie's Oxygen Brightener](https://www.amazon.com/Nellies-All-Natural-Brightener-Scoops-Removes/dp/B00KH4ENE8?th=1), OxiClean White Revive)
  - 1 part borax (e.g. [20 Mule Team Borax](https://www.amazon.com/Detergent-Booster-Multi-Purpose-Household-Cleaner/dp/B01KCJ8514))
  - 1 part washing soda (e.g. [ARM & HAMMER Super Washing Soda](https://www.amazon.com/Arm-Hammer-Super-Washing-Soda/dp/B0029XNTEU))

## Lotion

I thought this would be easy, but it turns out that making a water/oil emulsified lotion is quite difficult, and more importantly, requires preservatives to prevent bacterial and fungal growth.
So, the best alternative is to just buy off-the-shelf _fractionated coconut oil_, and use that directly.
