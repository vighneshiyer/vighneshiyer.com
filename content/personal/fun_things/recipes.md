## Pasta Dishes

### Cacio e Pepe

- [NOT ANOTHER COOKING SHOW: The Secret to the Creamiest Cacio e Pepe Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBg0DiHTImU)
  - [Recipe](https://www.notanothercookingshow.tv/post/the-4-greatest-methods-for-creamy-cacio-e-pepe)
  - Stick to the original method of making the sauce in the pan by aggressively stirring the pecorino into the pasta water
  - Use 1 tbsp of peppercorns per serving, toast on a flame until fragrant, then crush with mortar and pestle
  - Use 4oz (approx 114g) of spaghetti per serving
  - Grate plenty of pecorino (2-3oz per serving) on a very fine grate (either use the 'snow' holes in a box grater or a microplane)
  - **Do not** use salt in the pasta boiling water
  - Keep the pan for sauce making warm, but not on a flame. Add pasta water to the pepper 2-3 minutes before the pasta is al dente.
  - Stir aggressively when making the sauce. Make sure the pasta **has cooled down** (wait 1 minute) before adding pecorino or it will become clumpy and stringy. Add a little pecorino (2 handfuls, then the rest slowly) at a time along with pasta water to maintain temperature under 180F.
  - Before plating, warm plates in microwave for 30 seconds to get hot
- [This Pasta Looks Easy. Itâ€™s Not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W830FdF0yo8) - A masterful execution of cacio e pepe with rigatoni.
- [The Perfect Cacio e Pepe (No Tricks, Just Technique)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9iMw0dBJbw) - Another great execution.
  - Finish cooking the pasta in the pan with pepper broth to al dente. Then turn off the heat, wait until cooled a bit, then add cheese (microplaned is good), and emulsify with a touch of starch water.

<details>
  <summary>Retrospective after 3/24/2024 preparation</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>I overcooked the pasta, it was a bit past al dente - should pull pasta as soon as it reaches al dente</li>
    <li>The sauce pan was too hot when adding pecorino; I need to let the pasta cool for 1 minute along with the pasta water before I add cheese</li>
    <li>The sauce was overall quite creamy, but slightly clumpy and stringy - this is due to poor temperature control, and not enough vigorous mixing</li>
    <li>I used too much pepper (need to stick with 1 tbsp / serving or a bit less even)</li>
    <li>I should use higher quality pasta (bronze cut square spaghetti De Cecco) and fresher pecorino</li>
    <li>I tried to make garlic bread, but I only started it after I pulled the pasta - need to start it earlier and keep it under low flame until serving</li>
    <li><s>It's hard to grate enough pecorino - I should use the microplane vs the box grater.</s> Actually, the box grater is the way to go.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

[arXiv: Phase behavior of Cacio and Pepe sauce, Giacomo Bartolucci, et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00536) ([HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585707))

The takeaway is to use cornstarch or flour to emulsify the pasta water (starch) + pecorino sauce since their isn't enough starch in the pasta water you used to cook the pasta (unless you operate a restaurant which cooks tons of pasta or you reduce the pasta water).
Mix cornstarch or potato starch into a small amount of cold water, add the slurry to the sauce, and stir aggressively.
Don't let the cheese get too hot, although, with enough of the starch emulsifier, the temperature becomes less of an issue.

The referenced recipe: [Youtube: Cacio e Pepe: Original vs. Foolproof vs. Gourmet with Luciano Monosilio | Answering Babish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4eaNqTbDDA).

They give example ratios: 2 people, 240g of pasta, 160g of pecorino, 4g of starch (2-3% of the cheese).
Dissolve 4g of potato/corn starch in 40g of water, heat the mixture and stir until clear, then let it cool slightly.
*Blend* the starch mixture and cheese, adding a splash of water if necessary, until it is a smooth sauce and season with pepper.
Separately cook the pasta, drain it and let cool slightly before adding the sauce + pasta water.
The only thing I don't like about this recipe is the lack of toasted peppercorns, but that is easily remedied.

### Pasta Sauce Ideas

- [5 Restaurant Quality Pasta Sauces in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4NZllj854o)
- Vodka cream
  - Add very fine dice of 2-3 shallots and fine mince of 6+ cloves of garlic to olive oil in a wide bottom dutch oven + pinch of salt
  - After 5 minutes of sweating, add calabrian chilis and dried red chili flakes + more oil and continue to sweat for 2 minutes
  - Add one whole can of tomato paste and smash and sweat on medium heat until tomato begins to caramelize on the pan
  - Add 100g of vodka (maybe sake would work too) and cook for 30 seconds
  - Turn down the heat and add heavy cream, bring it to a simmer slowly while stirring
  - Bubble the sauce for 5 minutes and then stir in cooked pasta, butter and parm
  - Adjust with salt and pasta water
- Alfredo e pepe
  - Add 50g of butter to a wide enameled dutch oven
  - Once melted, create a roux with 20g of flour and whisk in until lumpless and sizzle for 1 minute
  - Add 500g of half and half while stirring constantly, bring to a simmer and then turn down the heat
  - After 5 minutes, kill the heat, add salt, black pepper, and 75g of hand grated pecorino and parmesean each (microplane is less advisable vs box grater)
  - Whisk until all melted without any added heat (ideally)
  - Add cooked fetuccini + pasta water and stir until fully coated, garnish with more pecorino, olive oil, and black pepper
- Pesto
  - 100g cubed parm into food processor and break down into small bits (couscous texture)
  - Add 100g untoasted pine nuts, 125g of olive oil, 100g of fresh basil (you need a lot of basil) + 5g salt and blend for 30 seconds
  - I'm a bit disinclined to use this food processor method and I would stick to mortar and pestle instead

  - Olive oil, 125 of small diced onions, 20g minced garlic, salt, and sweat until translucent (about 5 minutes)
  - Add 175g diced mushrooms + salt and cook 5 minutes

  - Add 200g heavy cream + a bit of water
  - Simmer and let reduce, should glaze a spoon. Adjust salt.
  - Cook ravioli and add

### Brown Butter + Sage Pasta

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v50OQFhc16U
- Quite simple, but beautiful.
- Melt unsalted butter and infuse with thinly sliced fresh sage. Continue cooking on low heat until the butter is slightly browned. Add starchy pasta water and cook down on low heat to form a sauce.
- In a separate bowl, grate parmesean and pecorino. Add a bit of starchy pasta water to form a cheese paste
- Dump almost-cooked rigatoni into the sage butter and continue to cook and absorb the remaining liquid. Continue to boil the pasta in the pan and add more water as needed. Add more unsalted butter near the end and emulsify. You want a nice and creamy butter sauce so keep shaking the pan and cooking down the liquid.
- Spoon the pasta onto a plate. Then add the cheese paste into the pan, some pasta water, and emulsify with the remaining butter. Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta. Top with more microplaned parm.

## Soups

### Tomato Soups

### Vegetable Soup

- [The Legendary Vegetable Soup from the Italian Michelin Restaurant Il Luogo di Aimo and Nadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx3xoCThDbE)

This is similar to a minestrone soup, with some important modifications.

- Toasted farro in the base vs pasta
- Blended cannellini beans used as a soup thickener and base
- Usage of infused olive oil with sage, rosemary, garlic (infused oil is made by crushing the spices in a mortar, adding olive oil, and letting it sit for a day in the fridge)
- Preparation of a separate vegetable broth using all the vegetable scraps, simultaneously with the soup production
- Fennel seeds used in the base soup seasoning and fennel flower/pollen powder used as garnish
- Whole cooked sorana beans are added to the soup

### Ribollita (Tuscan Bread Soup)

- https://www.allrecipes.com/ribollita-tuscan-bread-soup-recipe-11782482

### Fasolada (Greek White Bean Soup)

## Oriental Foods

### Ramen

- [Ultimate Vegetarian Ramen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riGNm51LiSw)
- [Just One Cookbook: Vegetarian Ramen](https://www.justonecookbook.com/vegetarian-ramen/)

- Finely grate garlic (2 cloves) and ginger (1" piece)
- Crush 2 tbsp of white sesame seeds in a mortar and pestle
- Slice green onions, separate whites and greens
- Cook grated garlic/ginger and whites of green onions in sesame oil on **low heat**
- Add chili bean paste (1/2 tsp) and toast
- Add 1 tsp miso + 1 tsp sugar + 1 tbsp soy sauce + 1 tbsp mirin (ideally sake) + ground sesame seeds and toast
- Add 150 ml miso broth
- Add 300 ml of coconut milk (this is not typical, but just my preference)
- Taste and adjust with salt and white pepper (should be fully seasoned by now, noodles will reduce the saltiness)
- Cook ramen noodles and add to broth poured into a ramen bowl
- Top with green onions, sesame seeds, sesame oil
- Notes from 4/16/2025
  - I made too much broth, should use only half a can of coconut milk. The taste itself was excellent, much to my surprise. Need to use real ramen noodles, not these thick Thai wheat ones. Need to start the broth first, it can sit simmering while I finish the rest and I can even cook the noodles in the broth.
  - No need to add the ground sesame seeds - they sink to the bottom and don't really add much flavor anyways. I should use more miso and cooking sake.
  - I blanched the bok choy in salted water as usual - tasted good. The tofu dish had too thick sauce and I didn't get the pan hot enough for the tofu not to stick. Next time, just use paneer instead of tofu lol. Avoid squishing tofu when drying. Use more sake and soy sauce. Use brown sugar over coconut sugar.
  - In the future, I should make miso soup with vegetables instead of blanched vegetables or tofu for ramen toppings.
  - I should just try to nail the plain ramen recipe before trying to do prepared tofu or vegetables toppings.

#### Ramen Toppings

- Vegetables
  - Blanch quartered bok choy or broccoli
  - Mushrooms, soy sauce glazed
- [Tofu Donburi]
  - Cut firm tofu into half inch pieces
  - Remove moisture with kitchen towels
  - Add corn/potato starch and dust the tofu pieces
  - Sauce: 1 tbsp brown sugar + 1 tbsp mirin (ideally sake) + 1 tbsp soy sauce
  - Shallow fry tofu pieces in non-aromatic oil for 3 minutes per side on medium heat
  - Turn heat to low and add sauce, coating every piece
  - Reduce and caramelize until glossy
  - Add 5g of unsalted butter
  - Low heat and keep warm until serving, top with sesame seeds
- Tofu and broccoli
  - Blanch broccoli in salted water and chill in ice water
  - Cube, add salt+pepper, coat tofu with cornstarch
  - Grate a few cloves of garlic + 1 in" ginger
  - Chop green onions and set apart whites and greens
  - Sauce: 1 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp oyster sauce (use hoisin), 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp shaoxing wine, 1 tsp of bouilion powder, 1/2 cup water, 1 tbsp cornstarch
  - Fry tofu for 6-7 minutes until brown, set aside
  - In oil, fry white parts of green onions, garlic, ginger for 1 minute
  - Add sauce and reduce 1 minute, add tofu and broccoli and heat through
  - Turn off heat and add toasted sesame oil + top with green onions

### Miso Soup

- Prepare dashi (just use a packet for now, but you can use kombu + dried shitake mushrooms too)
- Cook leafy green vegetables (e.g. boy choy, cabbage) in dashi under a boil
- Reduce heat to just below boil. Turn off heat before adding miso.
- Add 1 tbsp miso (1 tbsp per bowl) through a fine mesh strainer until dissolved (discard the koji or you can add it to the soup - it will settle to the bottom anyways)
- Add sliced silken tofu, sliced green onion, dried wakame seaweed
- Keep the heat **well under a boil** until everything is heated and serve (do not boil miso as it will lose flavor)

### Japanese Curry

- Prepare the curry roux
  - You can use a store bought Japanese curry cube / powder or store bought spice mix
  - 3 tbsp unsalted butter, melt, and mix 4 tbsp of flour
  - Cook and stir on medium heat for 12-15 minutes until a dark chocolate color is reached
  - Add 1 tbsp curry powder + 1 tbsp garam masala + a small bit of red pepper powder
  - Mix thoroughly and cool down
- Chop one onion into strips, 1 carrot into 1" pieces, 2 yukon gold potatoes into large cubes + any other hard squash
- Grate 1" ginger, chop bell peppers, chop 8 asparagus stems into large pieces, 1 japanese eggplant into large cubes (soak in water), chop 1 tomato
- Cook hard vegetables in oil on a wide bottom dutch oven with ginger, cover and reduce heat to low, cook for 20 minutes, stirring
- Once mostly cooked, add 3 cups of vegetable broth, 1 bay leaf, bring to boil and cook 3 minutes, remove from heat and cover
- In a frypan, add oil, cook eggplant for 8-10 minutes until browned, do the same with bell peppers and asparagus
- Add to the dutch oven and stir in a bit of curry roux
- Season with salt, add tomatoes, serve with rice

### Stir Fry Noodles

#### Basic Recipe

- Fry tofu / paneer / whatever separately, set aside. Coat with cornstarch or potato starch before pan frying using avocado oil. Can also include salt/papper in the mix.
- Blanch greens
  - e.g. bok choy, broccoli, chard
  - Blanching greens and dunking them in ice water works out better than trying to cook them in the pan itself
- Prep the sauce
  - Soy sauce + rice vinegar + mirin / sake + white pepper + sugar (+ ketchup)
  - Peanut satay sauce + coconut milk + mirin + soy sauce
- Cook noodles
  - Just boil ramen noodles
- Ingredient order for stir frying:
  - Whites of green onions, crushed garlic / ginger, chili bean paste in neural oil
  - Sliced onions, bell peppers, mushrooms
  - Root vegetables (carrots), cabbage, baby corn, bean sprouts
  - Blanched vegetables + tofu
  - Sauce + salt
  - Noodles, cut the heat quickly after mixing
  - Toppings: green onions, sesame seeds, crushed peanuts, cilantro, lime juice

#### Prep Notes

- The ingredient order should be: white-stems of green onions | large onion pieces | shredded cabbage and carrot | crispy tofu | garlic | noodles + sauce | juilenne green onion tops
  - Need to add bell peppers and onions early to cook them properly
  - Actually, avoid bell pepper, use smaller amount of garlic (just 3 cloves is enough)
  - Too much tofu, not enough cabbage, but that is OK
  - Use broccolini too next time
- Not hot enough, use large stove for the carbon steel pan
  - The cooking took too long, the vegetables became limp, they lost their color, and there was too much liquid in the pan (lead to boiling vs sauteeing)
- The tofu began to crumble and fall apart
  - Make the tofu crispy in sesame oil + soy sauce before adding it to the mix
- Noodles can be made by boiling water in the kettle and pouring the boiling water over the noodles to cook and rehydrate
- The sauce was not enough
  - Not salty enough due to low sodium soy sauce - needed to add salt manually after cooking, next time add to sauce directly
  - Add rice wine vinegar next time
  - Use mirin next time in place of sugar

### Chowmein

- [Short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TqYG5c23lcs)
  - Chop celery, cabbage, onion
  - Soy sauce, brown sugar, crushed ginger and garlic
  - Oil, onions fry, then cabbage and celery
  - Then add noodles and sauce
  - My take: probably replace the celery with the whites of green onions, add some tofu

### Manchurian

- This is an "Indo-Chinese" dish
- Prepare a batter: 3 tbsp cornstarch (sub arrowroot flour), 3 tbsp all-purpose flour, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp red chili powder, 1/8 tsp black pepper (optionally add sugar and ketchup). Add 5-6 tbsp water and mix until a thick batter forms
- Shallow fry the battered paneer until browned and set aside
- Prepare the sauce: 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp vinegar, 3 tbsp ketchup, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp sweet chili-garlic sauce, a few drops of sesame oil
- In the same pan, stir fry sliced garlic and the greens of green onions for 1 minute on medium heat
- Add medium-fine cubed red onions + bell peppers (maintain a 1:2 onion:pepper ratio) until partially cooked, 3-4 minutes
- Add the sauce and continue to cook for 1 minute
- Add a cornstarch / potato starch slurry to thicken the sauce. Adjust thickness with water until the sauce becomes glossy and thick. Cut the heat.

- Add 2 cans of coconut milk and stir to combine. Add water if needed to cover all the vegetables.
- Cover and simmer until all vegetables are cooked through
- Add brown/coconut sugar (1-2 tbsp), lime juice (1/2 lime) and simmer
- Serve with jasmine rice

<details>
<summary>Notes from Nov 2024 preparation</summary>
- I added too much salt, the curry paste already has salt, no need to keep salting
- I added too much curry paste (4-5 tbsp, it was too spicy)
- A bit more sugar is good
- I used 1 can coconut milk + 1 can coconut cream which made the sauce too thick (stick with 2 cans of coconut milk)
- This made a large quantity (3 med/large carrots, 1 potato, 1/2 onion, 1 paneer block) = 4 servings (at least)
