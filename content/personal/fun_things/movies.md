So I really don't like movies. But sometimes I see a few. Mostly while on airplanes. Here is what I think of the ones I've seen and bothered to write about.

## The Angry Birds Movie

- I saw this on a flight to somewhere a while ago
- I love it
- all the essentials of a plot are there and shine, plot is very easy to follow (of course, it is a kid's movie) (hard to follow plot doesn't make a movie bad btw)
- red bird is very relatable and sweet, lots of distinct characters that are developed super fast since they are human archetypes
- unexpectedly good, really really good for a kid's movie

## Equinox Flower

- I saw this at BAMPFA
- director: yasujiro ozu (good face)
- so beautiful, so japanese
- cute plot, a bit drawn out, but still nice
- slow paced (but still enjoyable), nice camera work, thoughtful dialogue (delivered slowly and deliberately), light humor (nothing crass)

## Yi Yi

- I saw this at BAMPFA
- director: edward yang (suspicious face)
- ugly, bad, wtf who would consider this one of the best movies of the 21st century? absolutely insane people.
- the only good scene was japanese (set in japan, with a japanese character)
- no plot, no character development, very very drawn out for no good reason
- taipei looks so bad in the movie (noisy, crowded, dirty urban space), nothing mystical, elegant, or beautiful
- characters are casted ugly, why are all the actors so ugly (physically), there is a notable very fat person (why?)
- random sexual injections / affairs, nonsensical, not beautiful
- all the characters are a bit distinct, but completely unrelatable, maybe this movie appeals to low class, poor, or unhealthy people. perhaps it only appeals to chinese or maybe particularly taiwanese and their particular racial character.
- even if you try to sell this movie as a "slice of life" film, it still fails since the life being portrayed is so unrelatable and ugly. again, i feel this movie isn't appealing for people with happy and rich lives.
- film "critics" should be disregarded. they must have various mental diseases

Some reviews I found on IMDB that match my experience (the movie is critically acclaimed, there are very few negative reviews):

> Edward Yang's film is bleak. If life, love and dying were this depressing, I'd wish to remain forever 8 years old. While there were a few poignant moments, these were few and far between, causing numerous people in the audience to leave before the touching conclusion three hours later. Most of the characters seemed to dread life, love, and the emotions that come with being human. And the women all seemed bent on destruction, sexually, spiritually, and emotionally. Breakdowns, crying fits, and indecision seem to plague these women with no sign of joy, humor, or compassion seeming to trickle into the cracks of their self-pitying prisons. Where are the redemptions, the creative sparks, and the connections with each other that keeps us alive? Only the young son and the Japanese software genius, Ota, seem to have a grasp of the beauty of giving something wondrous back to the world while also enjoying the pleasures and humor in life. Sorry to disagree with the majority of critics, but I can only recommend this film to foreign and art-house film lovers.

> This plot focuses on a father, his teenage daughter, and his 8-year-old boy. The stories of the father and daughter are for the most part, respectively, soap opera and melodrama, and not compelling. (The daughter is, for me, inert.)

> With beautiful and expressive shots, sensitive and eloquent direction, incredible acting by all involved, and a plethora of brilliantly quotable lines, add to that the fact it's considered a "slice-of-life" film, Yi Yi really could have been easily one of my favourite films of all time. Alas, I can't even say that I liked it!
>
> Two main reasons this film didn't resonate with me nearly as much as I expected are that: I didn't find the vast majority of the characters to be interesting, and I couldn't see why this is considered to be a slice-of-life film in the first place.
>
> The only character I was almost constantly interested in is Yang-Yang. I found the relationship between N.J. and Sherry quite absorbing and engrossing as well as the scenes with N.J. and his Japanese friend; I can't say I really cared about the character of N.J. as I was supposed to be.
>
> I couldn't care less about everything related to N.J.'s wife, teenage daughter, brother and business partners. Apart from one scene N.J.'s wife shares with N.J.'s mother that was a bit emotional, I found the film emotionally flat and almost fell asleep every time I see these above-mentioned characters. I found the story-line of Ting-Ting to be one of the most boring and uneventful I've seen in any film. Let alone the fact this film is 3 hours long!
>
> A slice-of-life is a term used to describe a piece of art or literature that shows or depicts the ordinary details of real life. And I'm enamored of any film or novel that can be classified under this, so to speak, sub-genre. The thing is I couldn't see that Yi Yi fits this description. What I saw, in the first 30 minuted in particular, are many of uninteresting characters acting in an absurd way. I really couldn't see that this film has mundane real-life events as most people do.

> The biggest problem with YiYi is that it lasts for at least an hour too long, without saying much in the process. Another major flaw was the way that it spells everything out, without trusting to the audience to pick up subtly expressed connections and motivations. Two examples readily come to mind. When the characters one at a time talk to the comatose, but off-screen grandmother, I realized that this was akin to a form of traditional ancestor worship. Then the main character, the businessman, says directly that this talking is like praying. A more blatant example was the inter-cutting and overly obvious parallels between the father's past as discussed in Tokyo and his daughters present back in Taipei. This is where good editing could have made the film more thought-provoking, less obvious and more interesting.
>
> Another problem for me was the fact that I couldn't connect or care about any of the characters. Possibly this was because they had trouble expressing emotion and interacting with each other, but I felt uninvolved with all of them. A pretty disappointing feat for a nearly 3 hour family character study. The camera work was also very static and dispassionate. At first, views through empty doorways, awaiting characters to walk through them, and long shots of couples seemed interesting. But their repetition and lack of variation made these distancing techniques become stultifying. This was especially true of the many long takes that occurred towards the end of the film.
>
> I also thought the main character showed a fairly limited acting range, while some of the crying scenes were given over to poor acting. Overall, I was left mostly bored and wishing I had chosen a better and shorter film for the evening.

> Although I was touched by a few scenes in this film, I felt mostly like Edward Yang was trying too hard to be "poignant" and "symbolic." Almost every scene is riddled with overly symbolic material that just made me roll my eyes or yell at my television. Examples of this include the scene where Yang Yang is watching the movie on lightening with its obvious sexual allusions and then sees the underpants of the girl who he secretly has a crush on. Another example was the whole cutting back and forth scene from Sherry and NJ in Tokyo back to NJ's children who are living out parts of NJ's childhood. I was like, "Oooo, deep, Mr. Yang. Deep." In addition, there is much annoying screaming in this movie. This is not something I usually notice in films, but I think there must have been a good ten to fifteen minutes of women (a few men) making annoying screaming noises. Another thing that bugged me about this film on video (no fault of Yang's) was that the subtitles were almost impossible to read for much of the film. Didn't the film company check this out when they were editing the film with subtitles? And finally, though this wasn't always the case, I guess I felt annoyed by the way the characters were all unconscious victims of the Confucion patriarchy/matriarchy and this fact was never brought to light by Yang. Though there are moments of sympathy in this film, I often feel this when I watch films with a Chinese focus. Hey, the archy hurts everyone, baby. Empathy is healing. Make sure you bust out a magnifying glass for the subtitles and some eye drops for eye rolling if you rent this film.

## One Week Friends (2022, Chinese Adaptation)

- i saw this on a flight somewhere, to NYC I think?
- i've never seen the Japanese version
  - i would want to see the japanese version next
- very sweet and nice movie, i liked it, i appreciate the theme of friendship over romantic love
- a bit too cliched and fantastical at times, a little too childish
