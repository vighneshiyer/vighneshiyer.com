### Data Structures

- [The Hunt for the Missing Data Type](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/graph-types/) ([HN link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39592444))
  - The author asks why there aren't any graph libraries in a stdlib when graphs are ubiquitous in many applications. One proposed reason is that graphs come in many forms (directed, hypergraphs, ubergraphs, bipartite) and each form usually has a different API and set of optimized algorithms. Since performance is critical, people often write custom graph libraries. In-memory graph representations are also very diverse and have significant impact on the performance and memory requirements of different types of graphs.
  - [A Response: The "missing" graph datatype already exists. It was invented in the '70s](https://tylerhou.com/posts/datalog-go-brrr/). [HN link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39606885)
    - The answer is Datalog - express graph algorithms declaratively and let the compiler choose the suitable in-memory representation and synthesize concrete imperative code to implement the algorithm.
