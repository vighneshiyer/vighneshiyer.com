It is nice to make cocktails at home to 1) customize them, 2) make them with the specific liquors that you like, 3) enjoy them in your own quiet space, and 4) save money.
I am by no means an expert on this topic but this is what I've learned so far.

## Equipment

First, there is some basic equipment that you need, that I wish I had from the start.
Just buy these things.

- *Large ice cube tray*: I liked these Tovolo "King Cube" silicon trays ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXF6H2Y))
- *Regular ice cube tray*: I bought some "no-spill" trays from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007U256D2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1))
- *Jigger*: There are 2 major varieties (double-ended and angled). You need to be able to measure 0.5-2.0 oz. I think the angled jiggers are way easier to use at home with less spillage than the double-ended kind. I like this one from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B6LUAPW)).
- *Rocks Glasses*: Of course you need glasses to serve cocktails in. Of all the varieties, I find 'rocks' glasses to be the most versatile, albeit not the prettiest. I bought these ones from Anchor Hocking ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BC3MI5O)). Coupes would be good next additions.
- *Citrus juicer*: These are cheap, just get any one
- *Mixing tin*: There are also cocktail mixing glasses, but I prefer a stainless steel mixing vessel. I have this one from American Metalcraft ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QQQGTWY)).
- *Hawthorne Strainer*: This OXO one is good ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DAQ93))
- *Cobbler shaker*: There are also Boston shakers, but a cobbler shaker is far easier to use at home. I got this one from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JW89TC3)). If I was OK spending $60 on this, I would buy the YETI one.
- *Bar spoon*: Just get some cheap bar spoons, the exact model doesn't matter.
- *Cooler*: I use an insulated bag to hold all my ice and cold liquors, but a proper hard-case insulated cooler would be better.
- *Corkscrew*: You need to be able to pull corks. Buy whatever is within your budget - these are all kind of the same.
- Toothpicks: The poor man's version of the fancy cocktail pick

## Prep

There is nothing to do except chill all your mixers and liquors.
Since all the cocktails I like are served chilled, I even chill the liquors that aren't typically chilled (whiskey, vermouth, rum, soju).

## Liquors

Here are things I've tried and what I think.
To be clear: I have no actual taste in alcohol.

### Whiskey

- *Maker's Mark 46*: I like it
- *Woodford Reserve (Regular)*: Pretty good, but I prefer Maker's 46 over this
- *Suntory Toki*: I really like it. Ideal for sipping, highballs, and sours
- *Four Roses Small Batch*: TBD.

### Rum

- *Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva*: TBD.

### Soju

- *Hwayo 25 Soju*: Has an initial taste much closer to sake than soju, but still inferior to sake. Good to try, but the aftertaste is still too alcoholic.
- *Ilpoom Jinro Oak 43 Soju*: TBD.

### Cocktail Liquors

- *Dolin Rouge (Sweet) Vermouth*: TBD.

### Garnishes

- *Luxadro cherries*: TBD. These are so expensive, it better be worth it.

## Recipe List

These aren't the "true" "official" recipes, but rather my own hacked together versions that I like.

### Old Fashioned

- In a cocktail mixing tin, add 1 bar spoon of simple syrup, 2 dashes of Angostura bitters, 4 dashes of orange bitters, and a splash of water. Stir to combine.
- Add regular ice, 2oz whiskey, and stir for 20-30 seconds.
  - Optionally, substitute the whiskey for rum, or split both 1oz:1oz
- Strain and pour over a large ice cube in a rocks glass. Garnish with a cherry.

### Sour

- In a cocktail shaker, add ice, 2oz whiskey
- Add 3oz fresh lemonade (the Trader Joe's refrigerated lemonade works perfect, no need for additional sweetener)
- Add the juice of about 1/4 of a lemon (use a citrus juicer)
- Shake hard for 10 seconds
- Strain and pour over a large ice cube in a rocks glass. Garnish with cherry.
- For a *NY Sour*, float 0.5oz of dry red wine (e.g. Malbec) over the back of a spoon

### Manhattan

- In a mixing tin, add ice, 2oz whiskey, 1oz sweet vermouth, and 2 dashes of Angostura bitters
- Stir 20-30 seconds until chilled and strain into glass (ice optional). Garnish with cherry.

### Highball

- Fill a tall glass with ice and pour 2oz whiskey
- Slowly top with mixer (cherry coke, sprite, whatever) (about 4-6oz)
- Stir gently a few times. Garnish with cherry.

### Daiquiri

- In a cocktail shaker, add 2oz rum, 1oz lime (or lemon) juice (about 1/2 of a lemon), 1-2 bar spoons of simple syrup. Stir well.
- Add ice and shake hard until chilled. Strain into a chilled coupe (no ice)

### El Presidente

- Rum, sweet vermouth, orange curacao, grenadine, cherry
- TBD. I don't have everything for this.
