It is nice to make cocktails at home to 1) customize them, 2) make them with the specific liquors that you like, 3) enjoy them in your own quiet space, and 4) save money.
I am by no means an expert on this topic but this is what I've learned so far.

## Equipment

First, there is some basic equipment that you need, that I wish I had from the start.
Just buy these things.

- *Large ice cube tray*: I liked these Tovolo "King Cube" silicon trays ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXF6H2Y))
- *Regular ice cube tray*: I bought some "no-spill" trays from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007U256D2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1))
- *Jigger*: There are 2 major varieties (double-ended and angled). You need to be able to measure 0.5-2.0 oz. I think the angled jiggers are way easier to use at home with less spillage than the double-ended kind. I like this one from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B6LUAPW)).
- *Rocks Glasses*: Of course you need glasses to serve cocktails in. Of all the varieties, I find 'rocks' glasses to be the most versatile, albeit not the prettiest. I bought these ones from Anchor Hocking ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BC3MI5O)). Coupes would be good next additions.
- *Citrus juicer*: These are cheap, just get any one
- *Mixing tin*: There are also cocktail mixing glasses, but I prefer a stainless steel mixing vessel. I have this one from American Metalcraft ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QQQGTWY)).
- *Hawthorne Strainer*: This OXO one is good ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DAQ93))
- *Cobbler shaker*: There are also Boston shakers, but a cobbler shaker is far easier to use at home. I got this one from OXO ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JW89TC3)). If I was OK spending $60 on this, I would buy the YETI one.
- *Bar spoon*: Just get some cheap bar spoons, the exact model doesn't matter.
- *Cooler*: I use an insulated bag to hold all my ice and cold liquors, but a proper hard-case insulated cooler would be better.
- *Corkscrew*: You need to be able to pull corks. Buy whatever is within your budget - these are all kind of the same.
- *Toothpicks*: The poor man's version of the fancy cocktail pick

## Prep

There is nothing to do except chill all your mixers and liquors.
Since all the cocktails I like are served chilled, I even chill the liquors that aren't typically chilled (whiskey, vermouth, rum, soju).

## Enumeration of Poisons

Here are things I've tried and what I think.
*To be clear*: I have no actual taste in alcohol.
Total amateur opinions to follow.

### Whiskey

- *Maker's Mark 46* (6/10): I like it. Good enough neat.
- *Woodford Reserve (Regular)* (4/10): Pretty good, but I prefer Maker's 46 over this. Not so great anymore after having better whiskeys.
- *Suntory Toki* (6/10): I really like it. Ideal for sipping, highballs, and sours. Not great neat.
- *Four Roses Small Batch* (8/10): The best so far. Excellent. Very smooth and flavorful. Very enjoyable neat.

### Rum

- *Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva*: I like it. A few feel it is too harsh, doesn't go down smooth, at least neat.

### Soju

- *Hwayo 25 Soju*: Has an initial taste much closer to sake than soju, but still inferior to sake. Good to try, but the aftertaste is still too alcoholic.
- *Ilpoom Jinro Oak 43 Soju*: TBD.

### Gin

- Citadelle Gin. TBD.

### Cocktail Liquors

- *Dolin Rouge (Sweet) Vermouth*: Decent, I have no comparison point.
- Cointreau: TBD
- TJ's Limoncello: TBD

### Wines

- Port
  - Porto Morgado Old Tawny (10 Years). Sits around $10 from Trader Joe's. Hits way way above its price point. We love this.
  - Porto Morgado Ruby. Not as good. Similar price point, but much worse than above imo.
  - Fairbanks Cellars California Port (1.5L). Cheap but bad. Stay away.
  - Warre's Otima 10 Tawny Porto. TBD
- Reds
  - Decoy Cabernet. Decent, hits a bit above its price point, but it's better to spend more.
  - Sean Thackrey Pleiades XXXII. Very good. Fruity and smooth.
  - Charles Shaw wines (all varieties). Very cheap, but do not buy lol. Get something nicer.
  - No Es Pituko Carignan 2024. So so smooth, hard to believe there was any alcohol at all. Excellent.
- Whites
  - 2021 Virgo Magic Wines 'Disco Lemonade' Riesling. Tastes heavily like brined olives. I think this is an acquired taste, not for a general audience.
  - Barefoot Moscato. Cheap, mild tasting, and gulpable. Get something nicer.
  - Risata Moscato d'Asti DOCG. Low alcohol, smooth, sweet, and fruity. A crowd favorite.
  - 2023 Nickel & Nickel Grand Sky Vineyard Chardonnay. Incredibly good, smooth, bright lime aftertaste.
- Orange
  - 2023 Gulp Hablo Orange (1L). TBD.
  - Pielihueso Naranjo 2024. Very very good. Smooth, slightly fruity, and crisp. Best served cold.
  - 2023 Suisun Valley Assyrtiko, Hydrangea Skin-Contact. Excellent.

### Sake

[Takara Sake](https://www.takarasake.com) has a sake factory in Berkeley, CA!
I highly recommend visiting them and doing a tasting.
What follows are all sakes from Takara (some brewed in Berkeley, others in Japan).

- Sho Chiku Bai REI Junmai Daiginjo. One of our favorites. Cheap and good, serve chilled, crisp, fruity, and smooth. If it is too old, it will acquire a mushroom-y flavor.
- Sho Chiku Bai Organic Nama. Good chilled, but has an earthy flavor. Not suitable for a general audience.
- Sho Chiku Bai Takara Sierra Cold. This is an insane sake. Serve chilled. 12% ABV but tastes like zero! Very light flavor of slight sweetness and fruit, but mostly tasteless.
- Sho Chiku Bai Nigori Crème de Sake. Cream sake! One of our favorites. Serve chilled. Flavor is both fruity and earthy, more on the sweet side.

### Meads

- The [Remeadies](https://www.remeadies.com/) meadery near Sequoia National Park is very good. Go there if nearby. Unfortunately, their meads aren't easily available in NorCal.

### Garnishes

- *Luxadro cherries*: TBD. These are so expensive, it better be worth it.
  - Totally worth it. So delicious and the syrup is great to add to a cocktail.
- Angostura bitters. It is what it is, pretty good - not many other options.

## Recipe List

These aren't the "true" "official" recipes, but rather my own hacked together versions that I like.

### Old Fashioned

- In a cocktail mixing tin, add 1 bar spoon of simple syrup, 2 dashes of Angostura bitters, 4 dashes of orange bitters, and a splash of water. Stir to combine.
- Add regular ice, 2oz whiskey, and stir for 20-30 seconds.
  - Optionally, substitute the whiskey for rum, or split both 1oz:1oz
- Strain and pour over a large ice cube in a rocks glass. Garnish with a cherry.

### Sour

- In a cocktail shaker, add ice, 2oz whiskey
- Add 3oz fresh lemonade (the Trader Joe's refrigerated unpasteurized lemonade works perfect, no need for additional sweetener)
- Add the juice of about 1/2 of a lemon (use a citrus juicer)
- Shake hard for 10 seconds
- Strain and pour over a large ice cube in a rocks glass. Garnish with cherry.
- For a *NY Sour*, float 0.5oz of dry red wine (e.g. Malbec) over the back of a spoon

### Manhattan

- In a mixing tin, add ice, 2oz whiskey, 1oz sweet vermouth (sub port), and 2 dashes of Angostura bitters
- Stir 20-30 seconds until chilled and strain into glass (no ice). Garnish with cherry.

### Highball

- Fill a tall glass with ice and pour 2oz whiskey
- Slowly top with mixer (cherry coke, sprite, whatever) (about 4-6oz)
- Stir gently a few times. Garnish with cherry.

### Daiquiri

- In a cocktail shaker, add 2oz rum, 1oz lime (or lemon) juice (about 1/2 of a lemon), 1-2 bar spoons of simple syrup. Stir well.
- Add ice and shake hard until chilled. Strain into a chilled coupe (no ice)

### El Presidente

- Rum, sweet vermouth, orange curacao, grenadine, cherry
- TBD. I don't have everything for this.
