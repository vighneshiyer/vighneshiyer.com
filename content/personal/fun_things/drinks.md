- [Feeding a Roman Legion | Posca & Laridum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj5vg2fjOtk)

> As an archaeologist I've tried a very similar drink - essentially the same type of origin, roman legionnaires - that one of my teachers took to one of our Byzantine classes. She called it "Phouska", and the recipe we used was 1.5 cups of vinegar, 0.5 cup of honey, 1 tablespoon of crushed coriander seed, and 4 cups of water, then boiling it until the honey is dissolved and then straining the coriander seeds. It's actually one of my favorite archaeological/historical dishes (closely tied with Babylonian date-and-nut bars, which I would eat daily if I wasn't allergic to nuts XD), and one Christmas I actually drank a few liters of Phouska across a couple of days.

<summary>Snake Juice</summary>

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Original Recipe**</span>

- No more than 2L of water per day is really needed unless you are doing lots of physical activity
- Start with slighly less sodium per L (1000mg) since 2g/L is the high-limit
- 2000mg/L (approx 1 tsp) of sodium (himalayan pink salt)
- 4700mg/day (approx 2 tsp) of potassium chloride
- 8 tbsp/day of lemon juice (can use bottled lemon juice or can squeeze fresh)
- 4 tbsp/day of ACV
- Use a high Ph water (Ph > 7, Alkalinity > 120ppm)
    - Avoid tap water, use Evian or other high-Ph water (use Ph strips to test water), tap water can be OK if properly checked

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">**Current Recipe**</span>

- Slightly different than the initial video; probably introduces more essential ingredients (such as magnesium)
- Also Cole recommends not using ACV or lemon juice in the snake juice but drinking them separately since they are acidic and will erode enamel if you don't brush soon
- Water=2L
- Potassium chloride = 1 tsp (No Salt)
- Sodium chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt)
- Sodium Bicarbonate = 1 tsp (Baking Soda)
- Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (Food Grade Epsom Salts)

- Preparation notes
  - There is too much salt, dial it back a bit

  - Replace sugar with another sweetener, maybe stevia so a smaller quantity can be used and it mixes easier with water
