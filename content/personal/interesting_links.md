### Functional Programming

- [Algebraic Effects from Scratch by Kit Langton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPvPdRbTF-E)
  - A great talk introducing algebraic effects from first principles and a sketched implementation of [Kyo](https://github.com/getkyo/kyo)

### Concurrent Programming

- [Concurrency Deep Dive: Async File IO in Java](https://concurrencydeepdives.com/asyncfileio.html)
  - This blog is insanely good: every article is filled with detailed information about the low-level concurrency primitives provided by the hardware and OS
  - [Scala's AsynchronousFileChannel is not truly asynchronous.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/1b6k0cs/scalas_asynchronousfilechannel_is_not_truly/)

### Data Structures

- [The Hunt for the Missing Data Type](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/graph-types/) ([HN link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39592444))
  - The author asks why there aren't any graph libraries in a stdlib when graphs are ubiquitous in many applications. One proposed reason is that graphs come in many forms (directed, hypergraphs, ubergraphs, bipartite) and each form usually has a different API and set of optimized algorithms. Since performance is critical, people often write custom graph libraries. In-memory graph representations are also very diverse and have significant impact on the performance and memory requirements of different types of graphs.
  - [A Response: The "missing" graph datatype already exists. It was invented in the '70s](https://tylerhou.com/posts/datalog-go-brrr/). [HN link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39606885)
    - The answer is Datalog - express graph algorithms declaratively and let the compiler choose the suitable in-memory representation and synthesize concrete imperative code to implement the algorithm.
