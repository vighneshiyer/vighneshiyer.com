- Consider a BS degree too - a jobs program even more
- GPA inflation over time
- Percentage of population with degrees
- Original notion of a PhD was a granted degree after the research is already done and proven independently
- Consider what the pure situation should be. Then what is the reality. How can we make everyone's interests line up? Who's interests are illegitimate to begin with?
- IQ of typical graduate over time
- The role of the university over time - with the sudden changes emerging in the past few decades.

> Three experts would review the request, we would have a three-day "defence" to avoid cheats.
>
> Everything would be public, both submitted document, defence and decision.
>
> A tax payer could do this for free (once!), the university and experts would get paid by the state. A foreigner would have to pay, and that would not be cheap.
