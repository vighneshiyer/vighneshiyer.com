I need some space to write about the transition from childhood education into primary education.
How do the principles change?
What is the correct method of education from about 4th grade or so until the beginning of higher education?
And this is a good place to talk about the bulk of classical education from the childhood article - that article should be more focused on true child things - from infancy into 4th grade.
