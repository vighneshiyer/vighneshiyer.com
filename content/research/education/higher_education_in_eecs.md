# Steps to A Proper EECS Education

## What Are We Doing?

What is a higher education for? For even higher education. For lifelong education. For encyclopedic education. For honoring the Gods. NOT FOR A JOB. THIS ISNT JOB TRAINING.

## The Setup

The ideal type of environment, no classes (especially no lectures), just tutors you can consult, the Oxford model is truly the best

## The Tools

Leverage language models

Pick the right materials

- EDA CAD course on Coursera
- Scott Beamer's course
- UMich / CMU CPU OoO uArch project-based courses
- https://wasmgroundup.com/ (compilers)
- Scala red book

## The Methodology

Master your tools. Master your OS. Master your CLI / shell. Master your editor. Master your VM. Make your life hard (suddenly switch to a tiling VM, CLI editor, ...), and it will pay off. Keep your computing environment simple (avoid usage of many random note-taking apps and so forth).

STOP taking notes. Just Do. Do again and again. Whatever you remember will be sufficient.

- Always be project driven to learn things (e.g. learn linear algebra basics because you want to understand PageRank, and learn no more than the minimum you need!) (e.g. learn about Nyquist sampling and immediately capture an audio waveform and play with subsampling or play with synthetic waveform data) (e.g. learn about modulation, then get a SDR, capture data, and demodulate a public signal). Always go from something you want to do or understand, and then learn about what you need. Avoid the structured class-oriented curriculum - nearly all the time, people come out of that thinking they 1) don't remember much and 2) have a weak understanding of the fundamentals that the class builds upon, and thus are still shaky about their understanding. Instead, just sidestep this concern altogether, and focus on learning practical things, and don't fret about solving exam problems or knowing the deep theory.
  - Always write what you learn, publish project reports (even if they are just a few paragraphs long with one plot and some code snippets! it's worth a lot more than you think)

Watch seminars / random talks on Youtube. You will be surprised by how much you learn compared to your peers who look at lecture slides alone.

Classics First

Read papers early and often


Encyclopedic knowledge in EECS is the bare minimum for an undergraduate education. (https://decal.best/)

> Set yourself a goal of understanding some system from top to bottom before you graduate. For example, you might want to know how the entire process of downloading and listening to an MP3 or OGG file works. This can be a good tool for integrating knowledge across different courses
