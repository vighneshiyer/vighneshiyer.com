> Today, Harvard stood up.
> Not for politics. But for principle.
>
> 💬 “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.”
>
> 💬 “Harvard remains open to dialogue about what the university has done, and is planning to do, to improve the experience of every member of its community. But Harvard is not prepared to agree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration.”
>
> As a professor here, I’m incredibly proud of and stand by our institution and our president, Alan Garber for defending the foundational values of higher education. Go Harvard University
>
> His message, "The Promise of American Higher Education," is worth reading: https://lnkd.in/ehQq-57F. It powerfully affirms Harvard’s commitment to academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and the pursuit of truth — even in the face of intense external pressure.
>
> To put things into perspective, I encourage you to read the Trump Administration’s demands to Harvard: https://lnkd.in/eeQrRaki
>
> (And just as I was writing this, I found out that "Harvard [has now been] Hit With $2.2 Billion Freeze After Defying Trump" -- https://lnkd.in/eggGBvTJ. Freedom comes at a price and that’s okay.)
>
> Speaking for myself and as a member of the higher education community, I recognize we’re not perfect. But as researchers and educators, we live in pursuit of progress—always questioning, always working to improve. That spirit isn’t a weakness. It’s our strength. And it’s how we build a better university and a better world. To that end, there’s work ahead—no doubt—we have to listen deeply, grow more justly, and live up to our ideals. Higher education is always a work in progress but that work must be done with integrity.
>
> To everyone in the Harvard community and more importantly in education—faculty, staff, students, and alumni—this is a time to show who we are, what we stand for and what we believe in.
>
> I stand by and for our motto (Veritas), which is the pursuit of truth. Put simply, it asks us to confront our imperfections, embrace our responsibilities, and press forward with consciousness.
>
> So, ask yourself: will you stand for the academic values we claim to uphold? Because if we’re not willing to defend and, when needed, improve those values, what meaning do our degrees hold?

> Industry needs academia. Yet, the academic pipeline is stalling.
>
> And you—yes, you in industry, with the higher-ed degree reading this LinkedIn post—your absence is nothing short of stunning.
>
> In case you’ve been out of the loop:
>
> - Univ. funding is being slashed: from the NSF and NIH.
> - Fewer students are being trained in universities.
> - Students are being deported.
> - Staff are being laid off.
>
> Yet here we are, pretending everything’s fine. Doomscrolling. Liking random posts. Applauding the random posts, while the very system that built your careers is falling apart. 🤷‍♂️ There. I said it. Someone had to do it.
>
> To help you understand the gravity of the situation we are facing, I wrote this for the ACM SIGARCH Blog—but it affects all industries:

> 📖 Read the piece: https://lnkd.in/ecTdmZc3
> ✍️ Sign the pledge: https://lnkd.in/eb2UxAWF
>
> If you’ve benefited from academia, now’s the time to show up.
>
> Do something—just don't do nothing. 🙏
>
> Help us help you. Because in the end, we’re all in this together.
> And whether you realize it or not: Industry needs academia.

> 189 grants. $191 million. Gone. All in a single day, while we were trying to meet the hashtag#NeurIPS deadline (on terminated projects).
>
> Yesterday, Harvard—and only Harvard—received official notice terminating 189 NSF grants, wiping out over $191 million in obligated federal National Science Foundation (NSF) research funding. 🤦‍♂️
>
> See https://lnkd.in/eWTB2iA2
>
> 🎯 Three grants were mine: Sustainable Computing @ the Edge/AI
> 🧑‍🏫 My colleagues/mentors lost their prestigious NSF Expeditions—Carbon Connect: An Ecosystem for Sustainable Computing.
> 🧑‍🎓 A good friend/assistant professor lost his NSF CAREER award: CO2-Efficient Computing.
>
> Hmm... there's a theme here 🤔 We're trying to prevent the world from burning up from the insatiable appetite for computing and hashtag#AI. That aside, 27 early CAREER awards (for junior faculty) were terminated.
>
> And here’s the ultimate 💥 Academic Paradox I can’t get over:
>
> ⏰ While all of this was unfolding on May 15th, I spent that day working with my students—wildly pretending—as if everything was OK to finish their four NeurIPS papers, which, of course, turned into zero sleep and too much caffeine through the night as we pushed to hit the 8am ET deadline this morning, May 16th.
>
> The real 👊 to the face is that we stayed up all night writing papers… for research, we no longer have funding 🤯
>
> On one hand, we are doing our jobs: training Ph.D. students, advancing knowledge, pushing SOTA. On the other hand, the entire engine driving the work is quite literally burning down right behind us: 🏎 Pedal to the metal… while the wheels are coming off.
>
> This academic paradox isn’t just exhausting; it’s simply unsustainable. If we (faculty) don't confront it, we will push ourselves to the breaking point.
>
> 🎓 Proud to be standing strong with my colleagues at Harvard University as we navigate through this. Bring it. We stand for a higher purpose—We are stewards of science. 💪🛡️
>
> This happened to us at Harvard first, but we all know that this isn’t just our problem—it’s a warning for all of us in academia, as it has been said.
>
> Happy Friday, everyone. Enjoy your weekend. Be strong 💪 😞

One king gave his righteous opinion:

> Let's put aside the astonishing fact that a Harvard professor can't write.
>
> What else caught my attention was "CO2-efficient computing," which seemed very frivolous. I went to check what it is. https://lnkd.in/e7A8-QkE (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2443033)
>
> "Carbon", the keyword that used to open so many doors just a few months ago, is mentioned 24 times on the page. And I don't blame the PI: if I were a GPT-powered grant application app, trained on successful grants for the past 20 years, I'd do the same.
>
> If you Ctrl-H "carbon" with what it means in the context - "energy" - the text loses its "our world is burning" appeal, but suddenly makes much more sense.
>
> I suggest the PI reapply. I don't believe this project is worth the $600K requested, though.

> The hits keep coming. 👊 First, it was research funding. Now, it’s our students. 🧑‍🎓 Harvard University lost its ability to enroll new and keep international students; our students risk losing their legal status :(
>
> 🚫 These young people (some of the best and brightest in the world), admitted on merit, came to learn and contribute. We welcomed them in good faith. Many go on to create jobs and drive innovation. See: https://lnkd.in/ectH6u5Y
>
> 🧠 Consider this: 24 immigrant co-founders of U.S. hashtag#AI companies, including OpenAI, Databricks, and Anthropic, received over 94% of all venture funding, nearly $119 billion. These immigrant founders educated in the U.S. didn’t just contribute to American AI leadership—they define it.

> Others lead major orgs that create market value:
> Arvind Krishna (IBM, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign),
> Jensen Huang (NVIDIA, Oregon State University & Stanford University),
> Sundar Pichai (Google, Stanford University & The Wharton School),
> Lisa Su (AMD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology),
> Lip-Bu Tan (Intel Corporation, MIT & University of San Francisco), and
> Satya Nadella (Microsoft, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee & The University of Chicago Booth School of Business).
>
> All were born abroad. All studied in the U.S. All stayed. All contribute to the U.S. economy. We are all deeply committed to maintaining U.S. leadership 🚀

> 📊 International students make up ~30% of Harvard’s body.
>
> 📣 How you can help:
>
> 🎓 In academia?
>
> Ask your institution to support co-enrollment and visa transfers, including costs, and maintain scholarships and financial aid for affected international students.
>
> 💼 In industry?
>
> These students are your future workforce. You can encourage your company to explain that such actions impact the talent pipeline and fuel long-term shareholder value.
