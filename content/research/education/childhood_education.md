But be real, how many children can be put through this and come out of it with anything to show for it?

> China's approach to talent development is already yielding impressive results, and the country is poised to continue its growth in technological innovation and scientific discovery. By focusing on early identification, providing the best resources, and fostering an environment that promotes creativity and critical thinking, China has created a system that maximizes its human capital.

> Other countries, including South Korea, can learn valuable lessons from China’s emphasis on early talent discovery, specialized education, and the cultivation of a culture that celebrates innovation. China’s rapid rise in global scientific and technological sectors is a testament to the effectiveness of this system, and it is likely that other nations will need to adapt similar strategies to remain competitive on the world stage.

There is a lot to write on the childhood screening procedures of other countries. Just as well there is plenty to say about the 'civil service exam' culture of East Asian countries and its advantages and detriments.

> Sure, here’s the short list of educational software that I feel comfortable recommending for young kids (age 2-5).
>
> At these ages I would suggest no more than 15-30 minutes/day learning from screens and getting off screens for the rest of the day. (With quality educational software, they won’t last much longer than that anyway before their brains get tired.)
>
> Reading:
>
> With good instruction and practice, it only takes a couple weeks to get a kid reading simple 3-letter words, and less than 200 hours to get to an early 2nd grade reading level.
>
> Of course @MentavaInc
>  is the best-in-class option here, but Reading dot com is a cheaper alternative. The main difference is that Mentava’s software is designed to teach the child directly, while reading dot com teaches the parent how to become an effective teacher, and then the parent teaches the child.
>
> I don’t recommend Khan Academy Kids, Reading Eggs, Teach Your Monster to Read or other similar apps that are primarily designed as fun supplements to more rigorous instruction that the child is receiving elsewhere
>
> Math:
>
> Spending a few hours a week with quality math software will let a lot of kids do algebra in 4th or 5th grade. Don’t bother teaching math until your kid can read.
>
> I’ve used Dreambox with all my kids and liked it. Beast Academy has better curriculum, but doesn’t support independent learning as well, which makes it a non-starter for me. Synthesis and Math Academy are the next-gen options but I haven’t had a chance to try them yet.
>
> Computer Science:
>
> If your kids can add and subtract fluently, they can start learning to program.
>
> The CS Fundamentals courses on code dot org (the lettered courses from Course A to Course F) are free and a great want to introduce kids to basic programming and comp sci theory.
>
> If your kid starts reading at 3, they can easily be doing math and programming at 4
