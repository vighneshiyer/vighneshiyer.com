# GPU Mode, Beyond CUDA, GTC Keynote

Three days of fun. What did I learn?

## GPU Mode

What an impressive group of people. There is a vision here. Make CUDA programming accessible and easy, and make it easy to write high performance custom kernels for training and inference.
I'm lucky to have an invite to this. Thanks Simon!
Just a group of highly motivated and competent people who just kept pushing collaborations between academic ML systems groups, startups, and industry. Eventually, they put together this showing right before GTC, and even got NVIDIA to sponsor the event! The logistics were fantastic.

## Beyond CUDA

https://lu.ma/beyondcuda25

Competent CUDA compiler/translator team

Chai AI person
HiggsFields AI person, very insane
Lots of technical problems, talks running way over 5 minutes
Organizers did the best they could, given this was their first time
Panels got broken into talks as presenters wanted the ability to present their own marketing slides instead of talking out loud during the panel. Not many useful takeaways from the panels.

- The comedians roasted AMD so badly. These were the people rejected or too poor to afford GTC lmao. True true.
- TixFix.ai, I am a founder, entire team is in Nepal lmao
- Fillers.ai, the girl is responding to clients, recommending doctors, and is herself a plastic surgeon it seems. Her face looked plastic and stiff, she does talk the talk and walk the walk.
- Dylan is a rich boy!
- Random girl who is a "CEO" of a "security company". Most security problems come from "misconfiguration" and our software solves it! lol
- Girl at the end not being able to say AMD, saying Intel instead
- This isn't a parody, these aren't audience plants, these are real people! Reality is actually beyond any Silicon Valley parody.
- The audience is filled with ignorant random people who have no clue what's going on. But the event was sold as this 'exclusive' event.
