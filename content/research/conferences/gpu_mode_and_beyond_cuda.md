# GPU Mode and Beyond CUDA

## GPU Mode

What an impressive group of people. There is a vision here. Make CUDA programming accessible and easy, and make it easy to write high performance custom kernels for training and inference.
I'm lucky to have an invite to this. Thanks Simon!
Just a group of highly motivated and competent people who just kept pushing collaborations between academic ML systems groups, startups, and industry. Eventually, they put together this showing right before GTC, and even got NVIDIA to sponsor the event! The logistics were fantastic.
