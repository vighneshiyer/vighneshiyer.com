- Just be transparent
- Why do no profs publish blog posts, their submitted proposals, meeting notes, slides for their group, wip code, code projects
- There are a few special ones, Adrian Sampson, kastner, Chris re, yanyan (but they are exceedingly few)
- Why is this not a default?
- Instead the only thing they have are carefully curated papers with no code, what are they hiding? Does anyone believe they will get "scooped"? Good research does not suffer from this problem, especially in computer architecture
- Professors should be obligated to maximum transparency but I feel they would feel like the emperor with no clothes - the truth will be laid bare and they will be embarrassed.
- I do as I say I should. I try to do everything I do as transparently as possible.
