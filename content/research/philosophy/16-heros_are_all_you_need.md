Idk what to call this article. But I want to write something about heroes.

Behind every great thing, there is always 1 (sometimes 2 or 3) heroes. Heroes shape everything, but this becomes especially apparent in software. The entire field is driven forward and relies on libraries, compilers, tools, operating systems, and so forth that sprung forth from just a single individual.

The great man theory of history is obviously true and the Ancients were correct that the opinions, feelings, thoughts, life experiences, routines, and so forth of the middle and lower classes is entirely irrelevant when you're trying to understand big events in history.

From this theory follows the necessity of hero worship. All great societies in their Golden Age practiced hero worship. It is only through hero worship that the budding heroes of the current day have something to emulate. Heroes span every industry, every facet of life, and every age range.

In contrast, what hero worship is practiced today? Are today's 'heroes' virtuous?

I felt this was necessary to write right before I went to SF for a Scala meetup where Li Haoyi is speaking. Haoyi is undoubtedly a hero. In fact, I would say he is the main hero of the Pythonic-Scala library ecosystem and there is no one greater than him. He is responsible for so much, and without him, all these things just wouldn't exist. All the 'collaborators' he has come after the fact. The reality is: the hero must exist, he must drive a stake in the ground, he must build from scratch, and then he comes to lead an army.

Is producing heroes just a matter of population size? Is there just some underlying 'hero proportion' and just spawning more biomass will produce more heros? This is unlikely.
