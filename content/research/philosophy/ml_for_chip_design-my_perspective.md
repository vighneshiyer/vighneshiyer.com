# ML for Chip Design: My Perspective

## Background

- Media buzz (see Googling)
- PR from EDA CAD companies
- Startup funding requests (see YC)
- Increasing sessions and panels in comp arch and EDA CAD / VLSI conferences
- Look at ML for CAD session in Hotchips
- MLCAD

## My Instinct

I know I've been very critical of these in the past (see Googling RL for placement and LLMs for X in chip design).
But there is room for good stuff too (and most of it uses very classical ML techniques, not deep nets).

### Good stuff

- Heuristic engineering
- Correlation analysis
- RL for natural games
- Coding assistance / documentation lookup

## A Breakdown Domain-by-Domain

### RTL design

- RTL verification collateral / testbenches
- RTL Simulation
- Analog / mixed-signal simulation
- Physics simulation
- IR drop simulation
- Verification
- Synthesis
- Placement
- Routing
- Standard cell design
- ATPG / post-silicon validation
- TCL scripting

## Where is the Opportunity?
