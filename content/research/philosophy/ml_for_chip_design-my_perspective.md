# ML for Chip Design: My Perspective

Before discussing ML specifically in the context of chip design, let me first discuss ML in general, and where it has found success.
After establishing the general philosophy of applying ML to problems, we can discuss how it can be applied to various steps in the chip design process.

## Background

- Media buzz (see Googling)
- PR from EDA CAD companies
- Startup funding requests (see YC)
- Increasing sessions and panels in comp arch and EDA CAD / VLSI conferences
- Look at ML for CAD session in Hotchips
- MLCAD

## My Instinct

I know I've been very critical of these in the past (see Googling RL for placement and LLMs for X in chip design).
But there is room for good stuff too (and most of it uses very classical ML techniques, not deep nets).

### Good stuff

- Heuristic engineering
- Correlation analysis
- RL for natural games
- Coding assistance / documentation lookup

## A Breakdown Domain-by-Domain

### RTL design

- RTL verification collateral / testbenches
- RTL Simulation
- Analog / mixed-signal simulation
- Physics simulation
- IR drop simulation
- Verification
- Synthesis
- Placement
- Routing
- OPC
- Standard cell design
- ATPG / post-silicon validation
- TCL scripting
- RFIC / photonics design

## Where is the Opportunity?
