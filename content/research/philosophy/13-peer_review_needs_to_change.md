# Review and Conferences

- OpenReview is a huge positive move that has recently been adopted widely
- Reputation matters, real name in front of review, or pseudonym even, similar to politics in nature
- No one criticizes the premise of any given paper, lots of quibbling about methodology and experiments and benchmarks but nothing about the motivation and philosophy underpinning the paper itself
- Anonymity is not valuable here. Come on, unless someone is writing a pure critique that may be viewed personally, there is no value hiding your true self. And even if you're writing a critique, put your name behind it!
- I predict with a fully transparent system, all the bad actors (paper pushers, dishonest reviewers, incompetent reviewers) will be purged in a matter of a year.

- No one should have to review any paper. If no one wants to review a paper of their own volition, for free, for fun, then it shouldn't be reviewed. Paper pushing is also about ego of the authors, the ability to bully others into reviewing their paper pushing is a motivating factor for them.
- Especially in an engineering discipline, if no one wants to review your paper, it means it has no impact or value. Unlike science, where papers can change paradigms and challenge earlier results, and where researchers might fear reviewing something that affects the future of their own field. In engineering (especially in our tiny niche of computer architecture), this never happens.
- I frequently review papers that I'm genuinely interested in. I will write notes and ideas and praise and criticisms. I write about these papers publicly as well as in my personal note archive (ideally I should make everything public, just a logistical matter and a matter of time). If that was the standard, 99% of garbage published at ISCA / ASPLOS / MICRO / HPCA would be eliminated quickly.

- Blog posts for conferences, websites first with archival media, and finally why is HTML eschewed in favor of PDFs (and no one pushes hard to change this)?
  - Conferences shouldn't have a 'proceedings' that is published at the conference. Rather, you should be able to submit your posts to various "sessions" and then others review your post (and criticize it and improve it)! At the conference, there is simply reading time and then discussion, and ideally collaboration.

> Is there any good reason for publishing papers as PDF instead of HTML? Imagine how much more accessible academic knowledge would be if it were a Wikipedia style web of papers

> What's weird is that this is exactly why HTML and the idea of "links" was invented
>
> This tells us something about academia and it's products
> ...
> suspect enough of academic science is outright fraud that the median paper is not just worthless but the author of the paper probably *hopes* that nobody reads it. They want the publishing, the citations, but they do not want the science, because there often is none.

> the more open and searchable, the easier it is for people to attempt replication, the harder it is to hide basic fraud. Not "we stole zillions" fraud but "I'm too lazy or these results don't work but I still want to be seen publishing to get my grant money or phd" fraud.
