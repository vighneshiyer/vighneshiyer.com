# Review and Conferences

- OpenReview is a huge positive move that has recently been adopted widely
- Reputation matters, real name in front of review, or pseudonym even, similar to politics in nature
- No one criticizes the premise of any given paper, lots of quibbling about methodology and experiments and benchmarks but nothing about the motivation and philosophy underpinning the paper itself
- Anonymity is not valuable here. Come on, unless someone is writing a pure critique that may be viewed personally, there is no value hiding your true self. And even if you're writing a critique, put your name behind it!
- I predict with a fully transparent system, all the bad actors (paper pushers, dishonest reviewers, incompetent reviewers) will be purged in a matter of a year.

- No one should have to review any paper. If no one wants to review a paper of their own volition, for free, for fun, then it shouldn't be reviewed. Paper pushing is also about ego of the authors, the ability to bully others into reviewing their paper pushing is a motivating factor for them.
- Especially in an engineering discipline, if no one wants to review your paper, it means it has no impact or value. Unlike science, where papers can change paradigms and challenge earlier results, and where researchers might fear reviewing something that affects the future of their own field. In engineering (especially in our tiny niche of computer architecture), this never happens.
- I frequently review papers that I'm genuinely interested in. I will write notes and ideas and praise and criticisms. I write about these papers publicly as well as in my personal note archive (ideally I should make everything public, just a logistical matter and a matter of time). If that was the standard, 99% of garbage published at ISCA / ASPLOS / MICRO / HPCA would be eliminated quickly.

- Blog posts for conferences, websites first with archival media, and finally why is HTML eschewed in favor of PDFs (and no one pushes hard to change this)?
  - Conferences shouldn't have a 'proceedings' that is published at the conference. Rather, you should be able to submit your posts to various "sessions" and then others review your post (and criticize it and improve it)! At the conference, there is simply reading time and then discussion, and ideally collaboration.

> suspect enough of academic science is outright fraud that the median paper is not just worthless but the author of the paper probably *hopes* that nobody reads it. They want the publishing, the citations, but they do not want the science, because there often is none.

> the more open and searchable, the easier it is for people to attempt replication, the harder it is to hide basic fraud. Not "we stole zillions" fraud but "I'm too lazy or these results don't work but I still want to be seen publishing to get my grant money or phd" fraud.

- Generally speaking, why do 'free market' squares like HN, reddit, twitter, ... and so forth surface much better research than conferences/journals?
- Consider the free market system where people pick things that are truly interesting and useful, use aggregate consensus and organic reputation-limited voting, and engage in 'peer review' via comments (this resembles the Roman Republic, not perfect and more reputation orientation would be even better).
- Compare with the 'conference' system where professor are worked like slaves, 'bidding' for papers, reading a bunch of garbage they don't care about, no involvement of industry experts interested in real problems, and the completely opaque process of 'peer review'.
- Why do we have to put up with these cartels? These academic conferences are worthless (in nearly all cases). Can an academic research group establish itself solely on self-published works, open source projects, and blog posts? Seems unlikely, but still worth trying, due to the cartel effects of the current academic 'review' system.

  - This is completely the wrong approach. NIPS is trying to reprimand people into reviewing random papers they don't really care about with all kinds of penalties. Trying to force 'reciprocal' reviewing is not a good idea.
  - This doesn't actually solve any problems. The root issue is that people are writing nonsense that no one cares about. And they want to force 'reciprocal' acknowledgement of nonsense to perpetuate this system of paper pushing.
  - Note how when people actually care about some paper, they print it out, read it, write notes, comment on it, talk about it with others, and so forth. It just so happens that only a handful of papers deserve this treatment and people give it this treatment **organically**, no forcing required. The solution is to leave papers to live or die on their own. Put things out there and have the good stuff organically rise to the top, while the vast majority of paper pushers are buried under their own garbage.
