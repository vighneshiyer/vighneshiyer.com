# What is research?

The term itself is polluted. Is "engineering" "research"? Does the field you are in determine what research is? Is implementation necessarily just 'infrastructure' that doesn't rise to the level of 'research'?

I argue that instead of talking about research, we should simply talk about good, irrelevant, mediocre, and bad work. And furthermore, we must understand what work should be done where. We also talk about what motivates the work to begin with. What work has good impact?
Finally, from the academic engineering research perspective, we discuss what broad categories of research would fall into good and bad buckets (and in the middle), and provide examples of each.

What is _good_ _engineering_ research?

As we have seen, the core of engineering is abstraction. Therefore good engineering research must be abstraction-oriented.

Application-driven vs application-oriented research.
  - Driven is often too direct
  - Oriented makes us see the abstractions that are common to applications

- "It works" is the worst argument
- If it ain't broke don't fix it
- Does it work well
- Is it optimal?
- Is it beautiful?
- Is it euphoric? Euphoric apis and where to find them
- Create a philosophy section of website, as a subfield of research
- I will place this article and comp arch article there

> If your research consists of doing the same hacks that people in industry can do at any time, then itâ€™s not research. Research is solving problems that are too deep, difficult, long-term, diffusely beneficial for industry to focus on.

## A Bit More Philosophical

### What is value?

What is valuable in this world? Only material things and things (theories, engineering) that can produce material things?

Is beauty intrinsically valuable?

### What is worth doing?

Is extrinsic value the only thing that makes research meaningful? Can research derive value independent of external value?

### What is meant by "impact"?
