## Engineered vs Natural Systems and Engineering vs Science

- Natural systems: observations - models - experiments - refined models
- Engineered systems: models - abstractions - physical reality
- self thinking abstractions can emerge even within an engineered system (emergent intelligence), nested intelligence
- biological abstractions exist on top of nature's primitives

### A Religious Aside

- If you will, the natural world is an engineered system, engineered by the gods
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy
- The system produced by the gods has some natural variation and noise, which the components (abstractions), humans, can leverage, leading to free will
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis

## Engineered Systems

- An engineered system is that which moves from the abstract to the physical, this even applies to software
  - An engineered system can be perfectly simulated with respect to its abstractions by construction while a natural system can not
- Engineered systems vs evolved systems vs natural systems
  - Are evolved systems just engineered natural systems? Neuromorphic approaches could fall in this bucket.
  - Perhaps, evolved systems can be both natural and engineered - they are an outcome of either system in a particular context / perspective

## Well what is the point of all this?

Two things: motivate what is good engineering research + understand where and how ML is powerful
