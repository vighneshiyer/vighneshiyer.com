## Two Types of Engineers

If I may be a little extreme, I find there are broadly two types of engineers.
I will describe the most extreme forms of each one, but of course, most people fall somewhere in the middle.

### The Type 1 Engineer

The first type of engineer is obsessed with first principles thinking.
He will always prefer to build things from scratch even if existing 'solutions' already exist.

In fact, he craves to tear old things down and build new things up, just for its own sake.
Usually it will be justified by saying that a fresh codebase will allow a set of better abstractions to emerge, but oftentimes, that might be too optimistic.
This type of engineer hates working on an existing codebase, and will often balk when he sees missed opportunities for abstraction, deprecated design patterns or API usage, or merely ugly-looking APIs.

He will be prone to rewriting existing code in a language he prefers, with a programming paradigm he sees as well suited for the problem, and with a new set of abstractions that he creates from scratch.
In the extreme case, he will simply refuse to work on an existing codebase that doesn't meet his exacting standards; this can prevent any progress altogether as he continues to deliberate about reengineering code rather than making any progress.

### The Type 2 Engineer

The second type of engineer is the polar opposite of the first.
He hates building things from scratch and thrives when working on incremental improvements on an existing, large, well oiled codebase.
He is noted for his perseverance and high tolerance.
in getting results and progress out of and high tolerance
This type of engineer often doesn't want to or, in many cases, is incapable of building things from scratch.

The type of engineer you want depends on the codebase you want him to work on (of course).
Try to coax out where someone lies on this spectrum.
