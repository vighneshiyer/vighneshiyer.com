Why a PhD?

- Matt mights PhD cartoon, I disagree strongly
  - https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/
  - this is intrinsically demoralizing
  - if this is how you think of a phd's outcome or how you picture what you get out of the process, you will not want to continue

- My own PhD advice, or really advice for research in general including industry and independent researchers
- Philosophy readings
- Examples of visions, Fred, Bachrach, white papers, Patterson talks and visions
- Broad base knowledge, start building, don't care about reinventing the wheel or boiling the ocean, seek experience in all disciplines even adjacent ones, don't focus on application domains, focus on the base tools of the trade
- Constant writing, survey writings and benchmarking is invaluable, follow Simon Peyton Jones for advice, look at the build systems a la carte paper as a great example
- Find the right peers, exclude people who don't care
- First of all do you really care, what is your intrinsic interest, are you dreaming about it, are you thinking about it constantly?
- Fight for what is right, just be honest
- Teach, teach, teach, the best way to learn, write textbooks even if you don't know the field yet
- Choose the right mentors and advisers, are they paper pushers? Are they free people, can they think? Do they think?
- Walk and walk
  - Choose the right environment and climate
  - Get into a routine, all the great thinkers did this, if they needed it then so do you, why handicap yourself
  - Is your brain static, can you think? Link to my other article about constant distractions and noise that normies run into
- study history of your field, study old talks, look at old lectures from older people who know the long history of the field and can recite it. there is lots to learn - same things happen over and over again
- Give lectures ad-hoc on a blackboard, no references, start to finish. Undergrads are eager to have this opportunity and you should be glad you have an audience.
