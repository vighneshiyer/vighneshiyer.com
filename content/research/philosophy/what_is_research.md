# What is research?

The term itself is polluted. Is "engineering" "research"? Does the field you are in determine what research is? Is implementation necessarily just 'infrastructure' and doesn't rise to the level of 'research'?

I argue that instead of talking about research, we simply talk about good, irrelevant, mediocre, and bad work. And furthermore, we talk about what work should be done where. We also talk about what motivates the work to begin with. What work has good impact?

## A Bit More Philosophical

### What is value?

What is valuable in this world? Only material things and things (theories, engineering) that can produce material things?

Is beauty intrinsically valuable?

### What is meant by "impact"?

Is extrinsic value the only thing that makes research meaningful? Can research derive value independent of external value?
