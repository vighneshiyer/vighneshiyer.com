# What is research?

The term itself is polluted. Is "engineering" "research"? Does the field you are in determine what research is? Is implementation necessarily just 'infrastructure' that doesn't rise to the level of 'research'?

I argue that instead of talking about research, we should simply talk about good, irrelevant, mediocre, and bad work. And furthermore, we must understand what work should be done where. We also talk about what motivates the work to begin with. What work has good impact?
Finally, from the academic engineering research perspective, we discuss what broad categories of research would fall into good and bad buckets (and in the middle), and provide examples of each.

## Research

### Engineering

## Purity

## Academic vs Industrial Engineering Research

Isn't product development research itself?

## What Makes Research Good vs Bad vs Irrelevant vs Mediocre

## A Bit More Philosophical

### What is value?

What is valuable in this world? Only material things and things (theories, engineering) that can produce material things?

Is beauty intrinsically valuable?

### What is worth doing?

Is extrinsic value the only thing that makes research meaningful? Can research derive value independent of external value?

### What is meant by "impact"?
