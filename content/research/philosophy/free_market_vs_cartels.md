Generally speaking, why do 'free market' squares like HN, reddit, twitter, ... and so forth surface much better research than conferences/journals?
Consider the free market system where people pick things that are truly interesting and useful, use aggregate consensus and organic reputation-limited voting, and engage in 'peer review' via comments (this resembles the Roman Republic, not perfect and more reputation orientation would be even better).
Compare with the 'conference' system where professor are worked like slaves, 'bidding' for papers, reading a bunch of garbage they don't care about, no involvement of industry experts interested in real problems, and the completely opaque process of 'peer review'.
Why do we have to put up with these cartels? These academic conferences are worthless (in nearly all cases). Can an academic research group establish itself solely on self-published works, open source projects, and blog posts? Seems unlikely, but still worth trying, due to the cartel effects of the current academic 'review' system.
