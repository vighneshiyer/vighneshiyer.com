# Just Be Honest

- https://jyywiki.cn/Letter.md
  - this letter is too good, the extreme honesty of the Chinese is something to admire. Would an American or European professor dare to write such a letter? What is the use of 'free speech' in America if you are constantly restrained by taboos? What are the downsides of not being able to attack the CCP and Xi if you can openly state such extreme things with your name attached? American free speech used to have real meaning; not anymore.

Prof. Yanyan's pertinent letter to computer architecture students, professors, and industry

I think the big lesson of his letter is: Just be Honest.
He seems to think that students would be turned off from working with him due to his honesty, but it is actually the opposite.
Honesty is such a rare trait today and by writing this letter he has put out a signal to honest students.
He is also calling out the cowardice of all his peers.
Who wouldn't want to work with him?

- Why can't people just be honest? There are certainly true believers in useless research, but I know there are those who know better and just don't speak up.
  - I notice that there is always an explanation that dishonest people have. This isn't merely the case in academia among professors and students, but is also pervasive in industry, especially among middle managers.
    - Oh, you can't tell the truth - it would not be conducive to getting more grants from clueless fund administrators.
    - You can't be mean - you have to pretend that everything is going OK. Think about the feelings of those doing the work.
    - You can't criticize this - how can we expect to get more money from sponsors if they hear our honest opinions about our own work?
  - Honesty always wins in the long run. Corruption and inertia can only last so long.
- Compare how the Chinese government works with industry and researchers and academic institutions vs how the American government works. Who is in charge of these fund allocations? Who can actually criticize and scrutinize these grant proposals? They are filled with infinite nonsense in so many cases. Paper pushing is the norm to get more funds which gets more papers. But we know there is nothing of value being produced. The Chinese government knows much better.
  - Xiangshan, iEDA, Nanjing university, BOSC, it goes on and on. As much as the Chinese criticize their government and their efforts, there is no doubt that they are working in their national interest. They are also producing top notch students (at least in terms of broad-base knowledge in computer architecture AND all adjacent fields up and down the stack). The Chinese leap onto new tools very quickly whereas similar efforts in the US are just laughable or nonexistent.

  - Before there was any risk of Trump or Musk or losing the election, everyone had no problem calling out the extreme graft and waste of this program. Not only would there be massive funds allocated to administrative expenses, far in excess of what is required, but there would be massive bailouts of failing enterprises to prop up their business arms which shouldn't be allowed to fester any longer (Intel and IBM being the prominent beneficiaries with their government bureaucrat friends to shovel money into their face).
  - People would criticize other's research (in private of course, to do so in public would be uncouth lol). This is good for a healthy environment and a proper execution of any engineering or research discipline, but due to lack of honesty it was already kept in private.
  - Pervasive corruption in all government granting processes, especially when it comes to academic grants. Knowing the admins and bureaucrats would get you a huge leg up - people who had nothing to do with each other would be forced to work in consortiums to please all the bureaucrats with participation across multiple universities, military contractors, and industry players. The people doing judging would often have their own research agendas that are buzzword-oriented and had nothing to do with establishing foundational technologies.
  - Suddenly, when they lost the election, reality began to set in. The reality of course hadn't changed, all the waste, fraud, corruption, and bad research was still there, but now there was a risk that the party would be over. Continuous lack of honesty lead to this reckoning. But when they thought back to the last Trump administration, people still believed they were safe. The deep state bureaucrats could continue to work behind the scenes, subverting the policies of the executive, and that was considered a good thing.
  - Now that dream has been shattered. For the very first time, the losers of this election are forced to deal with actual consequences for their loss. This is certainly unprecedented.
  - All of a sudden, all the grants and waste that they were bemoaning in private earlier, became the most precious things in the whole world. America was going to fail unless these expenditures were to continue! Never mind that these grants just sustained the usual graft pipeline of money to papers to influence to corruption to money. Defenders of the status quo would bring up government funding of fundamental research in the 50s and try to pretend as if that is anything like the academic situation today. The number of students, professors, and administrators have bloated beyond any reasonable levels and the amount of fundamental research government money goes to fund is quite negligible, especially in engineering.

- Just be honest: this is a common saying to children in Kindergarden. "Honesty is the best policy!"
  - This is to encourage kids to not lie about quite silly things, if we're *being honest*. But really, who cares about the hijinks of children. It really is about being 'kind' as a buffer to true and blunt honesty (pretend things are nice when they aren't).
  - But what happens over time? Honesty is actually the primitive state of children. Brutal, blunt honesty is bred out in favor of 'kindness' and other such nonsense. Eventually it works up to subtle lying and corruption, and that is considered being 'kind'. That is the true value that is elevated in the modern society, in direct contrast to the Greek ideal.
  - The supremacy of truth over everything else is the Greek ideal.

- The truth hurts. Often. It is important to separate the *essence* of the statement being made from the *manner* in which it is being made.
  - I would argue that no matter the manner of expression, if the essence is understood, the truth alone is as 'offensive' as it could ever be.
