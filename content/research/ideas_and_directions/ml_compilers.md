The space is moving so fast, no one has had time to survey it properly.
There are no systematic, fair comparisons between any two frameworks/libraries/APIs design to do the same thing.
Kernel design languages are also evolving too quickly (Triton, then cuTile, Python CUTLASS emerging at GTC 25)

- Cutlass vs thunderkittens vs triton
- Given a gemm, survey this!
- Also lower level too like raw cuda and ptx
- Also rocm
- Use a simpler kernel like saxpy
