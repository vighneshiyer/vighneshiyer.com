- Specialization identification, DSP Saturn extensions being extracted from kernels alone, and then even functional models, perf improvement estimation, automatic new functional units? So much possibility on the methodology side

- Unsolved questions in general purpose computing
- The marginal cost of an rob entry
- True benchmark construction and evaluation
- Variable length isa vs fixed tradeoffs
- Vliw vs packed simd vs cray vs rvv
- The ideal simt programming model and first principles architecture
- First principles programming model for data parallel algorithms
- Per instruction latency attribution and tracing and automatic perf optimization hints, another uarch difficulty
