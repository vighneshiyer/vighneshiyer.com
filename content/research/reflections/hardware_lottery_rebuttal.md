# Is There Really a "Hardware Lottery"?

No.

Exploitation of data parallel algorithms via architecture and programming model is the only thing that matters, and GPUs didn't 'permit' ML to become viable than any other data parallel architecture.

You can't accelerate yourself out of an intrinsically serial algorithm.

Custom functional units - one important outlier (see crypto accelerators, ZKP/AES/FHE, see SHA256 accelerators for Bitcoin, others for other cryptocurrencies).

It's easier than ever to prove your algorithm would be very good on custom hardware. Even more, you can get that custom hardware built more easily than ever nowadays if it is really justified - prototyping is cheap, and money for commercialization is plentiful.

The "hardware lottery", as portrayed by Sarah Hooker, is a myth.
