# The Next DEC

- The next way humans will interact with computers (ultimately HCI) thing
- Room-scale computer (DEC), desktop computing, cloud computing, laptop computing, mobile computing, smartwatches, ... what's next?
- Apple people
  - Humane pin is actually good, but it was too early actually
  - Meta glasses form factor seems reasonable
  - Brain implants are the next obvious one, but has a very long trajectory ahead
- Proliferation of random LLM for X things
  - LLM for video editing, slide creation, report generation, general browser navigation, IDEs (of course, the most powerful so far - Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Claude Code), ads (Icon)
  - An OS + app stack needs to unify all of these. Just dictate what you want the app to do and it does it (navigates the GUI, writes the code, executes things) appropriately
  - An obvious thing: me and Joonho were working on a pitch deck. I was dictating what to do and he did it. Making diagrams, changing colors, reorganizing layout, writing text. Why can't we automate this process - a completely new type of UI to a bunch of programs. I think everyone knows this is coming: but it still seems we are a long way away from a unified platform/model/API for it.
- Missing abilities:
  - Ability to sample camera and audio data, dynamically sample everything I see and hear and do every day and make all my requests context-aware
  - Long term memory
  - Need to leverage both local compute, storage, phone compute/storage, and cloud too
  - Voice cues
- So actually we talked about this during lunch on 3/12/2025, and I wish I had this thing. "Can you just summarize what we just talked about? Connect it to the history of consumer computing."

> I feel like all those AI agent attempts are misguided at their core because they don't attempt to create new ways but replace humans on the legacy systems. This is fundamentally shortsighted because the economy, life and everything is about humans interacting with humans.

> The current AI agent approach appears to be permutations of the joke about how people will make AI to expand their once sentence to a long nice e-mail and the AI on the receiving end will summarize that long e-mail into single sentence.

> I get that there's a use case for automating tasks on legacy systems but IMHO the real opportunity is the opportunity to remove most of the legacy systems.

> Feels like OpenAI really want to compete with its own ecosystem. I guess they are doing this to try to position themselves as the standard web index that everyone uses, and the standard RAG service, etc.

> But they could just make great services and live in the infra layer instead of trying to squeeze everyone out at the application layer. Seems unnecessarily ecosystem-hostile
