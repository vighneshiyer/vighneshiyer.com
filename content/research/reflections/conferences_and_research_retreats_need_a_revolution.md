# Meeting Methodology

What is the point of these talks? Droning on and on and everyone is on their laptops. How much does group cohesion and common thinking/philosophy play a role in this? Don't we also see this in very specialized settings (e.g. EDA CAD Birds of a Feather at DAC)?

What is the point of a research retreat or conference?

- This format of talks and dinner topics and breakout reports is so dumb. What is the goal of the retreat? Is this the most efficient and useful way of achieving it? Of course not, we waste a lot of time and hardly anyone cares about anything. Even the poster session and demos often don't give the right environment to ask the right questions, get simultaneous feedback from multiple sponsors and students, and talk calmly in a place where you don't have to raise your voice
- What if we rethink the format entirely while retaining this off-site hotel arrangement?
- The Amazon memo strategy seems interesting, very fine grained rooms where students and sponsors can interact with a subarea of the lab in a quiet space
- The lack of written documents after this retreat and just some garbage notes of breakout reports and the industry feedback is a huge problem

- Chinese meeting methodology, shared Google doc no talking
  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378239 (Docs – Open source alternative to Notion or Outline (github.com/suitenumerique)) - self hosted, seems ideal
  - The collaborative platform is supposed to be ephemeral. Edit the memo written by one person locally, paste it in this web app, do the reading + commenting + discussion during meeting, then during the meeting itself, collaboratively work on the conclusion / tasks / answers to questions. Then effectively make the document read only as plaintext that can stand alone, with every comment thread going away (discussions don't need to be preserved, just summarized in the memo conclusion itself).
- Memo production at the end of the retreat
- Noise is a huge problem, use the outdoors!
- Live feedback is unreasonable, we need time to think and report ideas and criticism

- How did ramp work?
- It used the same talk format but quite different in nature
- Don't talk about projects, talk about stacks, individuals should collaborate on a memo with respect to a stack

## Examples of Memo Meetings

I'll leave some comments about how each of these went.

- Yufeng (exploration of running ML workloads on RISC-V silicon): https://www.notion.so/ucb-bar/Summary-of-running-ML-workflows-on-SoCs-1a4f299403da80f297e0dc7f4ef0e856 (Summary of running ML workflows on SoCs)
  - From Yufeng, it seemed like the reading + commenting went well, but
  -
  - There needs to be a set of questions that must be answered or some task that has to be accomplished during the meeting.
- Kris (robotics workloads in general): https://www.notion.so/ucb-bar/Workload-Discussion-1adf299403da80c185e0f4645a7ccef7 (Workload Discussion)
  - The meeting needs to be fully self-contained, only invite people who are relevant and have roughly equivalent background knowledge and insight.
- Abe/Raghav (simulation infrastructure): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvPIXbElzDlxT7hiGjkRCKTYyxQXcrHX_eGZzcOc-DQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ewm3wiusakdd (Simulating Current and Future Research)
  - Couldn't stop from talking!
  - The meeting topic should be more tightly scoped, fewer people are needed
    - The memo was too long to be read + commented on in 15 minutes

## The Concept and Origin of FlyRead Meetings



**FlyRead Meetings**, fully named "Feishu Reading Meetings," is an efficient meeting model introduced by ByteDance's collaboration tool, Feishu. Its core concept replaces traditional PowerPoint presentations with collaborative document-based discussions to improve meeting efficiency and accuracy in information transmission. The key feature of FlyRead Meetings is that all content is documented and collaborated on through these documents. In the first 20 minutes of the meeting, participants read the document and leave comments. The organizer can directly reply to questions in the document or even @ specific individuals for further input. By the time the meeting officially begins, most questions are already addressed.



The inspiration for FlyRead Meetings comes from Amazon's meeting model. At Amazon, organizers are required to bring solutions rather than questions, with meeting materials prepared and shared in advance. Jeff Bezos and his senior executive team read printed memos before meetings, diving straight into discussions. This ensures everyone’s focus and effective thinking.

## Comparison Between FlyRead Meetings and Traditional Meeting Models



### Drawbacks of Traditional Meetings

1. **Time-Consuming PPT Preparation**: Creating PowerPoint slides often consumes excessive time, especially for layout, coloring, and visuals. This process can lead to information loss and requires additional explanations during meetings, making it inefficient and harder to replicate.

2. **Serial Communication**: Traditional meetings often follow a sequential pattern where one person speaks while others listen. This can waste time, particularly if the speaker is not concise, leaving others unable to share their viewpoints effectively.

3. **Attention Deficits**: Long meetings can lead to reduced attention spans among participants, negatively affecting decision-making quality.



### Advantages of FlyRead Meetings

1. **Content Collaboration**: All content is documented and collaborated on within a shared file.

2. **Focused Discussions**: Participants spend the first 20 minutes reading and annotating the document. Questions are answered in writing, and additional inputs can be sought via mentions.

3. **Parallel Questions**: Multiple participants can simultaneously pose questions in the document, reducing time spent compared to the traditional one-at-a-time questioning model.

## Key Steps to Implement FlyRead Meetings



### 1. Document Writing and Sharing

The organizer creates a clear and accurate document outlining the main topics, goals, and background information. This document is then shared with all participants, who are required to read it beforehand.



### 2. Silent Reading and Annotation

In the first 20 minutes of the meeting, participants silently read the document and leave comments. The organizer responds to these comments in writing, involving other stakeholders as needed. This step minimizes topic deviation and ensures participants focus on the key objectives.



### 3. Interactive Discussion and Problem-Solving

After the reading and commenting phase, the meeting transitions to an interactive discussion. The organizer addresses previously raised issues, ensuring in-depth and focused conversations.



### 4. Post-Meeting Action Plan

One major advantage of FlyRead Meetings is the reduced workload of creating meeting minutes. The collaborative document already serves as a record. Before ending the meeting, tasks are broken down into specific **what** (task), **who** (responsible person), and **when** (deadline). Each task is assigned and deadlines are clarified.

## Applications and Impact of FlyRead Meetings in Organizations



### Successful Case Studies



#### ByteDance’s Efficient Meeting Culture

At ByteDance, improving meeting efficiency has always been a focus. FlyRead Meetings were introduced to enhance productivity by mandating document-driven discussions. Participants review documents for 15 minutes before meetings, comment on any doubts, and discuss them one by one during the meeting. This method has improved efficiency, made discussions more focused, and ensured actionable outcomes.



#### Implementation in Other Enterprises

In a TGO Kunpeng meeting, the FlyRead model was adopted with a structure of 10 minutes for reading transcripts and slides, 10 minutes for presentation, and 10 minutes for Q&A. Content originally requiring 20 minutes to present was read in 10 minutes, significantly improving efficiency.



### Transformative Impact



1. **Improved Efficiency**: Companies reported a 30% reduction in meeting duration, a 25% improvement in decision-making efficiency, and a 20% increase in participant satisfaction.

2. **Cultural Shifts**: The model fosters a culture of efficiency and accountability, reducing ineffective communication and promoting clear, honest consensus.



---



## Challenges and Strategies for Implementation



1. **Organizer Competence**: FlyRead Meetings require organizers to create clear and logical documents, demanding strong writing and organizational skills.

2. **Cultural Adaptation**: The model challenges corporate inertia and requires cultural changes to encourage documentation and active participation.



---



## Future Outlook



1. **Optimizations and Innovations**: FlyRead Meetings can integrate intelligent tools to enhance document collaboration and efficiency further.

2. **Broader Applications**: Beyond tech companies, FlyRead Meetings have potential in education, healthcare, and other sectors to streamline processes and improve outcomes.

## Conclusion



FlyRead Meetings, through collaborative document-based discussions, address inefficiencies in traditional meetings. While there are challenges in implementation, its focused, efficient, and well-documented approach makes it a highly recommended model. With continued optimization and innovation, FlyRead Meetings are poised to drive effective collaboration and decision-making across industries.

# We Don’t Hate Meetings, We Hate Wasting Time on Ineffective Ones



## Intro



I believe many people have experienced this:

Sometimes, meetings feel like a form of torture.



Spontaneous brainstorming sessions, hastily announced “quick” meetings before the end of the workday, or so-called “leadership speeches” meant to disseminate corporate culture...



Various meetings that do little to accomplish actual work yet are unavoidable.



Sometimes, after a meeting, you feel utterly drained but achieve no real progress on important goals. Even when there are conclusions, they may lack value or fail to be executed, resulting in a significant waste of time.



Do we really need such meetings?



Sadly, in some cases, yes.



For organizational communication and goal alignment, meetings are still the most straightforward and practical method.



Since they’re inevitable, how do we make them effective?



Our small, modest company faces the same challenges, so we place great emphasis on one meeting in particular: the weekly meeting.



Why? Because conducting effective weekly meetings can significantly advance goals while avoiding many ineffective meetings.



Today, I’d like to humbly share our approach to weekly meetings. It may not be the most efficient, but it could provide some ideas for you.



Where to start? Let’s begin with our philosophy of meetings.



## What Is a Meeting?



At its core, a meeting is a business model that exchanges time for conclusions.



Like any business activity, it requires consideration of inputs and outputs.



Inputs: The time cost of all participants.

Outputs: A set of conclusions, consensus, or co-creation among participants.



However, many companies are oblivious to the cost of meetings. While they may require managerial approval for a reimbursement above $200, they have no qualms about wasting time on unproductive meetings.



For instance, a 4-hour meeting with 20 people, each costing $100 per hour, amounts to:



`100 x 20 x 4 = $8,000.`



An unproductive meeting costing $8,000 is a significant expense, yet nobody seems to care.



Some companies take it further, scheduling back-to-back daily meetings: morning meetings, brainstorming sessions, training workshops, project reviews, sharing sessions... The day is gone before you know it.



But meetings are meant to generate value that outweighs the time cost!



This is why we emphasize weekly meetings as a tool for efficiently driving goals forward.



## Why Weekly Meetings?



Like many companies, we set annual goals every year.



Goals lead to plans. But even the best plans deviate during execution. The greater the deviation, the worse the results.



What do we do? Hold meetings.



Meetings address deviations and facilitate course corrections.



Weekly meetings strike the perfect balance:



Unlike daily meetings, they aren’t overly frequent, allowing room for creativity and execution.



Unlike monthly or quarterly meetings, they don’t leave deviations unchecked for too long.



With weekly meetings, you get 50 opportunities annually to recalibrate, provide feedback, and make improvements.



By conducting effective weekly meetings, we can continuously align with our goals, avoiding ineffective gatherings.



## Our Approach: The "Document-Driven Meeting"



**Before the meeting**: Every business leader prepares a report, compiled into an online document.



**First 30 minutes**: Participants read the document together, comment, and identify questions directly within the document.



**Discussion**: Address all issues raised in the document, concluding the meeting once all points are covered.



This method works because many ineffective meetings stem from inadequate preparation. For instance:



- Leaders may ramble for hours because they haven’t clarified their objectives.



- Spontaneous meetings lack clear agendas, resulting in aimless discussions.



With a document-driven meeting, participants:



- Organize their thoughts logically beforehand.



- Synchronize information and understanding during the meeting.



- This preparation ensures that discussions are focused and productive.





## Key Element: The Four Dimensions of the Report



To ensure effective meetings, our reports cover four critical dimensions:



#### 1. Annual Goals:



State the annual target, the current expected achievement, and the actual progress.

Example:



- Annual target: 1 million new followers.



- Weekly target: 20,000 followers.



- Actual progress: 19,000 followers.



This comparison highlights gaps and helps leaders focus on closing them.



#### 2. Weekly Variance:



Compare the expected vs. actual results for the week.

Example:



- Weekly target: 20,000 followers.



- Actual progress: 15,000 followers.



- Variance: -5,000.



Tracking trends in variance alerts leaders to deviations early.



#### 3. Execution Review:



Review tasks from the previous week. Were they completed?

Example:



- Task: Conduct one-on-one meetings with each writer.



- Status: Completed, with notes on any special observations.



#### 4. Action Plan:

Outline tasks and objectives for the upcoming week.



Example:



- Target: Close the variance gap by gaining 25,000 followers next week.



- Action: Implement a specific campaign to achieve this target.



#### Final Step: Consensus and Action List

At the end of the meeting:



Record all decisions as actionable commitments.



Create a clear task list specifying who, what, and by when for each action item.





By adhering to this structure, weekly meetings in our small company have become a powerful tool for driving strategic objectives.



So next time you find yourself dreading a meeting, consider: Is it the meeting itself, or its lack of effectiveness?



Master the art of meetings, and they can become not just tolerable but valuable.



Good luck with your weekly meetings!
