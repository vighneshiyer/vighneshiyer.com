- On the biology stuff
- So the first thing that stands out is how much manual effort is required for anything, many mice have to be injected and killed, compare to the bloodless process of running architecture simulation lol
  - In the mice torture mention vivisection verboten and impeachment of man
- Then discuss about how a problem is selected, and every step taken to narrow down the cause of action, often you will try to isolate something and it has its own effects and also you ignore all the other factors that could influence too (neurotransmitter study), you have to get this entire chain and at each step there is attrition of the effect size but you proceed on
- There is no simulation! Evolved systems or natural systems vs engineered systems, there is a role for ml to play here that is much stronger than in our field
- When identifying causality chains you have to rely on measured data from other papers, how is this all figured out? There are failed experiments, bad measurements and obscure papers, LLMs might help here but is there a database?
- The research things begin to look like monkey stuff very quickly, that is hard for morale and for being confident in the drug combo
- You are forced to evaluate things in an isolated context, due to the full system complexity being too much, this introduces its own problems
- Infrastructure research seems lacking, a software driven approach would be useful and there are only a few steps made here, no wonder Google llm scientist does well at bio hypothesizing, it is about pulling together strings of causality across many papers, but ultimately that rarely leads to a new drug

- A PhD isn't enough at all, to be a prof or even an industry researcher you need one and often even two postdocs to publish a paper in science or nature, it seems this is mostly down to the very advanced techniques and experiments you need to run to prove to the reviewers that you've exhausted all ways to prove your hypothesis and made as many caveats as possible, it requires a huge number of researchers per paper and tons of human labor, but it still is monkey at the end of the day. It is obvious that this isn't the way. In this specific case it is about increasing survival of brain metastasized tumors by a month or two from a baseline of 4-6 months, I mean what are we even doing here? This is ridiculous
- What about basic holistic research into the body and metabolism, it seems many things are still not understood, let alone the origin of cancer in the first place, what does this accomplish?
- If we look at what the NIH is up to, it is often about these kinds of monkey research which eats up lots of cash and humans, what about working on fundamental simulation methods or similar? Seems a switch to basic research is in order, invention of new imaging techniques and assays and gene editing technologies are certainly good though, I wonder how much drug research is like this though
