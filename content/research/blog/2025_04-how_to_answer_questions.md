## After a Talk

Oh no, someone asked you a question during/after a talk you gave. Or during an interview. Don't panic!

Preliminary:

Prevention is always better than cure.

- Don't get yourself into situations you aren't prepared for.

Things to do:

- Ask for very specific examples of the general principle being asked about. Dissect the example rather than try to refute some general and vague point.
- Attack the premise of the question itself. In cases where the question is precise and technical, avoid quibbling over technical details so long as your quibbling is about differences within an order of magnitude. In such cases, appeal to whether the question is relevant in the first place.

Things not to do:

- Ask for needless 'clarifications' or 'repetition' from the questioner. Some claim this gives you time to think and makes the questioner look like someone who doesn't know specifics. I disagree. It makes you look like someone without the ability to fill in the gaps and answer clearly. Clarifications can come after your answer. If you ask for clarification constantly, you will stick out easily!

## For a Person

Always answer questions publicly. Try to avoid private platforms. If someone sends you an email, you should send them a blog post.
Avoid 'discussions' and "let's have a chat" situations (only friends get these privileges). Ask for written questions and you can supply written answers. Avoid senseless meetings!
