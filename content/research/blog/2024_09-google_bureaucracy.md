For the first time at Google I was working with people who genuinely, firmly, at their core, had no real interest in anything except the paycheck. I do believe this is very well-adjusted and have a hard time explaining the feeling and what it leads to without sounding derogetary. Your post does such an excellent job of pointing at it.

> Sad but when I was there the decline was in the making. Sundar just accelerated it. The culture was not changing with more people joining and too many people joined all through “contacts” and some leader pulling their people in. That’s the start of decline, once a leader gets their own people from outside at much higher levels it's painful to watch how much lack of vision caused the issues.
