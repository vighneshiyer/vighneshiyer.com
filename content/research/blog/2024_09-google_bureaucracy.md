> That self-selection combined with the...qualities...of Android completely changed the job. For the first time at Google I was working with people who genuinely, firmly, at their core, had no real interest in anything except the paycheck. I do believe this is very well-adjusted and have a hard time explaining the feeling and what it leads to without sounding derogetary. Your post does such an excellent job of pointing at it.

  - Meeting Philosophy. LMAO, it is so accurate and reflects the truth of Googling

> Sad but when I was there the decline was in the making. Sundar just accelerated it. The culture was not changing with more people joining and too many people joined all through “contacts” and some leader pulling their people in. That’s the start of decline, once a leader gets their own people from outside at much higher levels it's painful to watch how much lack of vision caused the issues.

  - The latest design slop from Google. They just can't get it right. Obsession with random 'user studies' and attempts to be quantitative about certain things ("how fast can people find the send button in the gmail app") but completely ignore other things (how much of the email I'm writing is actually visible on screen without constantly scrolling). Very typical of the modern design language. Information density of all Google products gets worse and worse over time and they then try to hack on some kind of "dense UI" mode to recover from this lol. Toolbar bloat at google is also out of control, every PM needs their own toolbar and you get insane GCP UIs that have 5 toolbars of hierarchy.

    - The website itself is laggy even on my modern-ish laptop (I'm sure the designers are using M4 Max Macbook Pros naturally)
    - Why hijack the cursor and add a smoothing animation? These people are crazy.

> M3 Expressive designs were rated higher across desirability attributes, including “modernity,” “subculture,” and “rebelliousness.”

Yes, these things are "desirable" to moron designers and corporate airheads. Not to real users.

The reality of the 'designer'. Soon to be deprecated.
