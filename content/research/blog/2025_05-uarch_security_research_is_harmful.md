# Uarch Security Research is Both Fake and Harmful

<!-- - for the 'research blog' - timely random research-related thoughts -->

### My Carbon Paper

- The carbon cost of microarchitectural side channels
  - Consider all the random mitigations necessary that are turned on by default even though they have such a tiny attack surface
  - Consider the massive performance loss (especially on older silicon) and the impact of that wrt how much more compute has to be acquired and manufactured (embodied carbon + extra emissions)
  - The uarch side channel security researchers have produced **harmful research** and are **personally responsible** for countless extra tons of carbon emissions
  - We argue that these people and their insane and unreasonable hypothetical attack vectors should be ignored for the sake of the planet and human survival
