> To be fair, I'm not too optimistic about this whole project. I'm still baffled at the performance and efficiency difference between the Exynos 2400 and the Tensor G4, especially considering they were on the same node.

> > Somehow it's sometimes worse than the G3 in performance even. Makes no sense unless something went catastrophically wrong as even the Exynos 2400 was still quite competitive in nearly everything except high-power(>8W) efficiency, somewhat behind in graphics compared to the 8G3.
