IMO when starting my career I want to take a bit of risk and understand what the real problems in industry are.
This is, to some degree, to motivate myself to get back into academia or startup land.
Or of course, I can begin in startup land from the very beginning, which is also a decent idea.
I am biased against ML/LLM startups, but there are certain hardware startups I find very enticing.
So here is my list of interesting employers.

## Established Players

- Intel Labs
- NVIDIA Research
- The typical gamut of quant firms: Jane Street, HRT, Citadel
- Google Cloud
- Apple HWT / PA
- Palantir

## Mid/Late-Stage Startups

- Rivos
- Tenstorrent
- Ventana
- Anduril
- SiFive (iffy)

## Startups

- Comma AI
- JITX
- Zendar

OK, I take back all of this nit stuff. The solution is simple. No spreadsheets. Just do interviews, understand who you're talking to, figure out how competent the people are and join based on pure instinct. You want to be surrounded by people who are all superior to you. That is how I made my decision.
