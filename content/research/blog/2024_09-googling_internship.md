## Googling

- Taking the bus on the first day. My office. Microkitchens. play rooms, internal google maps, ability to use any office, desks randomly assigned, open seating, multiple people on one desk oftentimes with time multiplexing, the coffee bar, the drinks - vitamin water is sniped asap, and rest of the drinks are constantly pulled out, fresh fruits always available, lots of snacks and cereal, and coffee machine of course.
- Meetings are the mainstay of the googlers. nothing makes them happier than attending and especially organizing meetings. even though a lot of the desks are vacant, the meeting rooms are always packed round the clock.
- my project itself. poorly organized. lux didn't have anyone to greet him for 2 weeks into his internship. the same useless 'trainings' are required in google as other companies, but it is a lot more time intensive.
- the googling development platform. blaze, code review tool, kubernetes, borg, CitC, Cider, lots of interesting tools that they have done quite seriously. their build engineers are very competent and skilled.
- cafeterias and lunch + dinner. families lmao. ice cream, dessert, lots of free food
- the carousel from the cafeteria to the ice cream station and then to the coffee bar. weight gain is the norm lol
- chromebooks for all, except if you are special or higher up. android phones for all, unless you are special or higher up. once you go past a certain level, then everyone uses macbooks and iphones lmao. this is very unlike apple where you are shamed if you use android and everyone uses apple things. apps internal to apple are ios only. whereas google needs to support both, even though everyone wants to use apple products. dogfooding is a very stupid concept to be frank.
- firings and restrucutrings are common. before i joined there had already been 2 restructurings earlier in the year. random people are shuffled around - there is no concern for their knowledge, background, or ability to contribute in their area. most people work autonomously, but that is a big problem when you're trying to build silicon.
- people leave often. startups or poaching is common. google pay and perks are very good, but it becomes quite demoralizing to work there long term.
- success is rare. products are killed often (everyone knows this). it is uncommon for a googlers to be proud of what they've built, rather they are proud of exploiting the ad revenue for their personal enrichment.
- extreme leadership and purging is required to restore google to its former glory. especially from the hw side, the only solutions are musk-style leadership or acquisition while maintaining separation.
- deepmind people are special. they have their own canopy building. no one is allowed in. unlike any other building in google.
- what about the edge tpu. consider the things in their HW org on the google cloud side and otherwise related to custom silicon. edge tpu tried Chisel, was big, then they died off without proper support. TPU continued, but it is probably only TCO beneficial once the NVIDIA margin is considered, as a product itself, it probably isn't competitive. they seem to have something similar to aws nitro (which is all thanks to their acquisition of Annapurna). they use outsourcing all the time - broadcom and marvell are the big ones - the internal PD teams are meager, that is done by the pros. density of googling silicon is quite low. tensor SoC is a big mess and is still mostly outsourced - even stapling ARM IP together is a challenge with a budget similar to apple. budget is rarely the problem when it comes to custom silicon - the leadership and vision and skills of the team are the most important.
- recruiters are outsourced!

- Why is there ipc in the gem5 embedding? How do we handle dvfs of the trace itself?
- Time based sampling vs inst based, embedding aggregation for soc, trace scheduler
- Trace driven time sync error, scheduler error, inst based interval error, trace model mismatch

- Culture of blameless criticism vs fake niceness
- Driving others to do better always
- Brutal focus on the outcome
- Secrecy that actually matters, being proud of your team, team morale vs apple
- Playing around, abusing the company benefits, unfocused work environment
- People give support on 'moonshot proposals' even if they have no idea what they're talking about. Just having a bunch of people with good titles saying nice things about your proposal is sufficient. Smart voices are rare and are easily drowned out.

- Google isn't (that) special. Analyze Google workload traces against our open source workloads and compare, they are quite similar

- Foreign languages
- Google couples
- Money focus of new people, pure exploitation
- Segregation at apple, others not allowed at engineering cafes, serves a purpose beyond secrecy of projects, segregation doesn't exist here
- I was wrong, it serves a valuable purpose, please forgive me jobs
- The guest policy is another thing, compare Google and apple, guests degrade the environment doesn't feel cohesive anymore, makes you worry about others, moves focus outside of the workplace
- Many bfs bring their gfs here to eat dinner, why don't the girls break up with them lmao, just absolutely insane
- I thought there was intrinsic value in transparency, that is still true but only if there is nothing to protect
- Mountain view vs Sunnyvale, white workers vs everyone else
- Highly politicized company, many activist groups fighting for political influence over c suite and funding poured into their pet projects and human pets too
- Musk is badly needed, vast swaths of this company can be eradicated and nothing would be worse off, but as long as human costs are small vs hardware and other costs, this is unlikely to happen
- Search monopoly will surely be broken, ads on youtube will continue dominance, everything else is iffy, waymo was actually a good job
- See the value of acquisitions when the internal company culture is so degraded and degenerate
- Badge stupidity, temp for no reason, no access controls, renewal without notice of deactivation, same with bus schedule thing
- At least the buses run frequently and stop in the right places, but they couldn't bother to capture who is using the buses and notify them when a change is in place
- Google bikes are interesting, how are they not stolen more often? A relic of a past time
- The perks are not what they used to be, abuse is rampant, apple has a point, free has no value at the point of use, paying even a nominal amount makes a massive difference in human behavior even with people of high integrity already
- Empty offices, extreme incompetence. No respect for the company from employees, it is seen as a money pile ripe for exploitation and extraction. temporary badge fiasco.

- Trace driven sim is almost an oxymoron
- Trace implies execution

- The lack of a founding myth
- Chinese team with a single white, he would have long coding convos with the handful of Chinese women lol, Indian only teams, further split by language
- Savings in terms of swe salary, Google compute units

- "be googley" - this might have had some meaning during the days of Sergey and Page
  - it might have meant: "act with honor"
  - but today, it is basically "be nice!" "be kind!", just reduced to a meaningless slogan

- googlers are 'productive' they are experts at writing their performance reports and getting high scores on performance reviews. they certainly close lots of issues, fix bugs, write lots of code, create features, generate data. but what is the point? productivity in the googling sense is actually degradation. there is no mission, no leadership, no competence up the stack (managers, don't know engineering, can't build a proper team). contrast with apple. software people are everywhere, even on hw teams and leading hw teams even if they know absolutely nothing. constant reorganization and reshuffling, no one is a true expert.
- actual experts get ignored constantly. there are threads and google docs with comments from smart people, but they are buried under a pile of nonsense from morons who don't know what they are talking about.
- google docs used for everything, documentation is an absolute mess, contrast with apple's confluence beauty
- checks and balances (CI2 vs PIE), duplicate products, no trust for each other, competition that doesn't produce better results lol
- no cult at google. who would worship sundar? what a joke. vs anduril, apple, tesla/spacex, microsoft, and even amazon?
