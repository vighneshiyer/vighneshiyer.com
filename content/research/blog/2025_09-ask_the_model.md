## Prelude

Deep in the depths of the ocean, near Bikini Bottom, there is one Club Spongebob...

## The Situation

The problem I have is that these people have made "asking the model/agent" its own area of research, rather than using the model/agent as an accelerator to produce high impact research products! That is the root of the problem. This is just lazy work.

Look at "MLArchSys", MLSys, and so forth...

### A Better Path

This is a counterexample from Mark Ren. He's not just asking the model as the research itself, but he's asking the model to produce a better SAT solver as the main contribution and can discuss what code it generated to produce a better solver. The focus is on the product, not the model. Excellent work.

## Sutton's "Bitter Lesson"

  - Ahhh the "bitter lesson". Grossly misunderstood and misapplied.
  - It is kind of like the "central limit theorem". Also misunderstood and misapplied.

## Model Hysteria in Academia

Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford, I'm sure many others are on this same path.

  - An entirely LLM generated website. This is the most obscene example.

  - "vibe research"
  - Absolutely insane that this is considered 'academic'

  - Asking the model in a loop. This isn't that bad compared to the others honestly.
