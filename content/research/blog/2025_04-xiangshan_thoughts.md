## Xiangshan Thoughts

> Americaâ€™s lead in compute is rapidly evaporating and there is no credible response from the investment community and no coherent understanding of the problem in government

> Why is the top performing open source CPU (XiangShan) Chinese? Where's the American project to beat this? Gonna lose so hard if America keeps investing in scams, instead invest in things like this.

- Xiangshan is just Chinese Chipyard with Chinese BOOM and Chinese SiFive LLC. All of American origin. Once the greatest American (Krste Asanovic) went into industry - it was over. The power of one man.

  - The talent development pipeline in China is unmatched. There is no urgency on the American side to improve our situation.
  - The Chinese indeed are producing tons of paper mills that churn out mostly useless garbage for credential stuffing (Shanghai Jiao Tong University being the most prominent), but they are also nurturing a handful of true computer architecture talents who will change the industry (mostly via Huawei and Alibaba). The same cannot be said for American universities or semiconductor companies which, through bureaucracy and fake rules, are not nurturing new talent.
