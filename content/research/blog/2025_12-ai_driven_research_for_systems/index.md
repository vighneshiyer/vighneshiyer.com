> 🚀 Excited to share our updated paper on AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS)!
> 
> We evaluate three open-source frameworks—OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve—across 10 real-world research problems. The results are clear: AI is no longer just tuning "black box" configurations; it is now capable of rewriting "white box" system code to outperform human experts.
> 
> Across domains like networking, databases, and core systems, ADRS discovered solutions that matched or surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines—often in under 8 hours and for less than $30 in compute.
> 
> Key results from our evaluation:
> ☁️ Cloud Cost Optimization (CBL): Achieves 35% greater savings on spot instances than the SOTA baseline.
> 🎓 MoE Load Balancing (EPLB): Generates a rebalancing algorithm 13x faster than top proprietary implementations.
> 🗄️ KV Cache Optimization (LLM-SQL): Matches SOTA hit rates while reducing runtime by 3.9x.
> ⛁ Transaction Scheduling (TXN): Improves a strong baseline by 60% for the offline case.
> 
> 💡 What we discovered:
> One of the most fascinating aspects of this research is Cross-Domain Discovery. Because LLMs are trained on diverse datasets, they identify structural parallels between systems problems and unrelated fields. For instance, ADRS "rediscoveres" 18th-century political science algorithms (Hamilton’s Apportionment) to balance MoE experts and used Social Choice Theory (voting methods) to minimize database conflicts.
> 
> 🧠 Best Practices for the Future of Systems Research:
> Applying these frameworks effectively requires a strategic shift in how we approach research, focusing on three axes:
> 1. Specifications: Less is more and more is less.
> 2. Evaluation: The solution is only as good as the evaluator.
> 3. Feedback: The "devil is in the details.
> 
> 📢 A Multiplier for Human Ingenuity:
> As systems grow increasingly complex—with heterogeneous clusters and massive MoE models—ADRS serves as a multiplier for researchers. It allows us to shift our focus from the tedious manual design of algorithms to high-level problem specification and goal-setting.

> 👋 Join the Community!
> We are actively building this ecosystem and will soon release a new framework and a standardized leaderboard to benchmark AI performance on systems tasks.
