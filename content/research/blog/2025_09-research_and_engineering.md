> There is a difference between research and engineering in (1) modus operandi, (2) methodology, (3) openness, (4) evaluation criteria.
>
> Research uses the methodology of science to discover new principles, demonstrate that they can work in practice, analyze their advantages and limitations, and interact with the wider research community to criticize, validate, reproduce, compare, and improve. The criteria are conceptual simplicity, theoretical beauty/explainability, clear performance advantage over prior art on some accepted metrics. This is true for research in academia as well as in industry.
>
> Engineering integrates methods, often developed in a research mode, to build working systems. The philosophy is to go with the first set of methods that work well enough for the task. It generally involves a lot of tinkering, tweaking, fine-tuning, and an occasional kludge to get the performance up on a real task. Whether the method is the absolute best matters less than whether it is good enough for the tasks at hand.
>
> Researchers are evaluated largely on intellectual impact. Research evaluation is a difficult task because the product impact may occur years (sometimes decades) after the work. For that reason, evaluation must often rely on the collective opinion of the research community through proxies such as publications, citations, invited talks, awards, etc. That's one reason research must be published.
>
> Engineers are evaluated largely on product impact, sometimes through proxy metrics such as pull requests, lines of code, etc.
>
> By operating in engineering mode, researchers are incentivize to do incremental work. If you make no distinction between the two activities, if you don't evaluate researchers and engineers with different criteria, you run the risk of killing breakthrough innovation. True breakthroughs require teams with a long horizon and minimal constraints from product development and management.
>
> The industry research labs of yore that have left an indelible mark on scientific and technological progress (Bell Labs Area 11, IBM Research, Xerox PARC, etc) were all research divisions that were clearly separate from engineering divisions.

> To qualify as Science a piece of research must be correct and reproducible.
> To be correct and reproducible, it must be described in sufficient details in a publication.
> To be 'published' (to receive a seal of approval) the publication must be checked for correctness by reviewers.
> To be reproduced, the publication must be widely available to the community and sufficiently interesting.
>
> If you do research and don't publish, it's not Science.
> Without peer review and reproducibility, chances are your methodology was flawed and you fooled yourself into thinking you did something great.
> No one will ever hear about your work.
> No one will pick it up and build on top of it.
> No one will build new technology and products with it.
> Your work will have been in vain.
> You'll die bitter and forgotten.
>
> If you never published your research but somehow developed it into a product, you might die rich.
> But you'll still be a bit bitter and largely forgotten.

> Hey AI journalists and pundits.
> Not everyone who works on AI is a "researcher".
>
> Researchers tend to:
> - publish at least some of their research results and open source at least some of their code: look at their Google Scholar page or their GitHub.
> - have an impact on other researchers and on the tech the community through their publications and open source code: look at their citation count and h-index on their Google Scholar page.
> - have a PhD in a field related to AI. There are good researchers without PhDs, but it's rather rare.
> - Have published papers during their graduate studies and kept publishing after starting their job. If they stopped publishing, they became engineers or managers.
>
> As I pointed out in a previous post, research and engineering/product development are two different activities, with different motivations, different incentives, and different modus operandi.
> Some people can do both, some can only do one.
> Quite a few people move from research to engineering or management during their career (more rarely in the other direction).
> But to put it simply, researchers are measured by their intellectual impact, engineers by their product impact.
> Both are necessary to the advancement of science and technology.

- Something has to be said about this. This mentality is laughable.
