## Prelude

Deep in the depths of the ocean, in Bikini Bottom, there was one Club Spongebob[^1].
High up on a tall tree, sits the clubhouse, occupied by a sponge and Patrick.

[^1]: [Season 3, Episode 42a](https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Club_SpongeBob). Watch the episode please.

On this fine day, Squidward exits his [Moai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai) to see these two barnacle heads laughing it up in their treehouse.
Of course, there is nothing more irritating than their giggling.
And when Squidward was told he wouldn't "fit in" their club, he couldn't take it.
He had to join! And so up he went.

But once inside, he found out that, indeed, he couldn't physically "fit in" the clubhouse and was now squished next to Bob and Patrick.

Squidward, desperate to escape, reaches for a branch and tries to pull himself down.

As he's almost down, the branch rips apart, and the treehouse is launched into the sky (sea).
The clubhouse flies through the sea and comes crashing down in the thick Kelp Forest.

Oh no, Squid is trapped. Lost. Hundreds of miles from civilization.

{{ gallery(images=[

    "club_spongebob_6-1.webp",

He starts to panic. How can he escape these two morons now?

But luckily, Squidward is part of Club Spongebob, and they have one trick up their sleeve: *the Magic Conch*.

{{ image(path="club_spongebob_7.webp", class="inset", caption="The Magic Conch is here to save the day!") }}

> **Squidward**: You've got to be kidding! That is just a stupid toy! How can that possibly help us?!
>
> **SpongeBob**: [gasps] Squidward! We must never question the wisdom of the Magic Conch! The club always takes its advice before we do anything!
>
> **Patrick**: The shell knows all!

{{ gallery(images=[
    "club_spongebob_8-0.webp",
    "club_spongebob_8-1.webp",
], popout=false) }}

> **SpongeBob**: Oh, Magic Conch Shell. What do we need to do to get out of the Kelp Forest?
>
> **Magic Conch**: *Nothing*.
>
> **Patrick**: The shell has spoken!
>
> **Squidward**: *Nothing*?! We can't just sit here and do nothing!
>
> **Squidward**: I can't believe you two are gonna take advice from a toy!

{{ gallery(images=[
    "club_spongebob_9-0.webp",
    "club_spongebob_9-1.webp",
], popout=false, caption="Just do what the Conch tells you to do.") }}

Squidward thinks he's smarter than the Magic Conch, so he runs and runs to escape the forest, only to find out he's running in circles and is right back at Club Spongebob.
He sets up a camp with the resources he has while SpongeBob and Patrick continue to listen to the Conch.

{{ gallery(images=[
    "club_spongebob_10-0.webp",
    "club_spongebob_10-1.webp",
], popout=false, caption="Squidward is certain he's smarter than the Conch followers") }}

Right as Squidward was about to enjoy his roasted sea insect, a miracle falls from the sky, right into the camp of SpongeBob and Patrick!
What a gift from the Magic Conch!

{{ gallery(images=[
    "club_spongebob_11-0.webp",
    "club_spongebob_11-1.webp",
], popout=false, caption="The gift from the Conch has arrived!") }}

As SpongeBob and Patrick enjoy their feast, Squidward begs to be allowed to touch the food.
They inform Squid that *only the Conch* can approve his request.
And so he asks the Conch, again and again, "may I have something to eat?"

{{ gallery(images=[
 ^   "club_spongebob_12-0.webp",
    "club_spongebob_12-1.webp",
], popout=false) }}

But he didn't give the Conch its due earlier, so the Conch only gives him a simple "no".
Squidward goes crazy as the Conch seems to be aware of his dismissal of its powers.

And then, someone cuts a path into the forest!

{{ gallery(images=[
    "club_spongebob_13-1.webp",
    "club_spongebob_13-0.webp",
], popout=false, caption="The Kelp Forest ranger has arrived to save Squidward!") }}

Squidward screams in delight - someone is here to save them!

{{ gallery(images=[
    "club_spongebob_14-0.webp",
    "club_spongebob_14-1.webp",
], popout=false) }}

But to Squid's dismay, the ranger also has a Conch of his own.

> **Kelp Forest Ranger**: All right, Magic Conch... what do we do now?
>
> **Magic Conch**: *Nothing*.
>
> **SpongeBob, Patrick, and Kelp Forest Ranger**: All hail the Magic Conch!

### Sound Familiar?

And so they sit, in silence, in devotion to the Conch, until another miracle falls from the sky.
Perhaps, if they ask it again and again, it will give them the answer to their problem.
Perhaps, a new version of the Conch will do better than the old one.

Whenever you have a question, don't think, just ask the Conch[^2].
And whatever the Conch tells you, is what you should parrot to others and follow diligently.

[^2]: The Conch = a large language model (henceforth called "the model")

But, just because it worked for SpongeBob, doesn't mean it will work for you.
As I will discuss, there is indeed a growing movement of people who believe the Conch will enable them to do nothing, and that good things will fall out of the sky.

<!-- Patrick: The shell has spoken! The shell knows all! - Patrick Star -->

<!--
Bikini bottom, squid tried to join, flung into the forest, and to get out they reach for the model! Sound familiar? Ask the model and do what it says. Don't think further. Just because it worked for SpongeBob doesn't mean it will work for you ðŸ˜†. Do nothing and good things will happen and they will fall out of the sky lmao.

## The Situation

There has been a lot said over the past two decades about how electronics can sap away our thinking powers.
When humans lose the ability to *be bored* and produce something from nothing, their mental faculties decay.


Electronics have always reduced attention spans, and the test scores are going down year after year. Some of this is due to dysgenic breeding, others due to demographic shifts into populations with lower IQ, but in just the past 2 years, a lot can be attributed to the model. The highest performer won't be affected and they will actually be supercharged, but the rest will lump into the bottom mode.

The bimodal distribution of students, very smart first year ugrads that can learn themselves. Also morons who can't learn and just ask the model and produce garbage code they don't understand and can't explain.

### The End of Thinking


- https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-end-of-thinking

### "Asking the Model" as Research

The problem I have is that these people have made "asking the model/agent" its own area of research, rather than using the model/agent as an accelerator to produce high impact research products! That is the root of the problem. This is just lazy work.

Look at "MLArchSys", MLSys, and so forth...

They will test some problem with Mr. Model v10 and then by the time the paper is done and experiments are final, Mr. Model v11 has been released and everything is done for. So many papers like this.

### Thinking in "Embedding Space"

If I could peer into their head I'm sure all I would find is a vector database.

"Semantics". If insufficient data is available, then the model will emit things that are adjacent in the embedding space. The 'intelligence' appears when the suitable training data exists to actually disambiguate the semantics of words that appear close, but are actually different.

The degeneration of the professor class, they are nothing more than frontends for Mr. Model, they operate and think in embedding space. They ask the model first rather than think and the model taints their thinking and makes original thought impossible.

## Sutton's "Bitter Lesson"

- https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf
  - Ahhh the "bitter lesson". Grossly misunderstood and misapplied.
  - It is kind of like the "central limit theorem". Also misunderstood and misapplied.

## Model Hysteria in Academia

Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford, I'm sure many others are on this same path.

- https://harvard-edge.github.io/cs249r_fall2025/
  - An entirely LLM generated website. This is the most obscene example.

- https://ucbsky.github.io/ucbsky-cs294-264-fall2025/course-website.html
  - "vibe research"
  - Absolutely insane that this is considered 'academic'

  - Add Sagar's class too, but point out that there isn't any extreme "asking the model" insanity directly in the reading list as of yet.
- https://cs329a.stanford.edu/
  - Asking the model in a loop. This isn't that bad compared to the others honestly.

## A Better Path

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mark-h-r-4837318_nvidiaresearch-ugcPost-7374877258735558656-Vm8H?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAVUAnMBjBFeQj_67eMIA1E2610ABsluQic
This is a counterexample from Mark Ren. He's not just asking the model as the research itself, but he's asking the model to produce a better SAT solver as the main contribution and can discuss what code it generated to produce a better solver. The focus is on the product, not the model. Excellent work.

## Conclusion

You know what?
Perhaps I'm wrong.
Perhaps "asking the model" is the most useful, impactful, and important thing we can all do today.

In the next few years, I may be the one saying:

> **Squidward**: *All hail the Magic Conch*
