- sequencer
- chipsalliance and rocketchip takeover
- scala 3 chisel port by sequencer's minions
- obsession over novelty is absurd in engineering. superior engineering *is* novelty
- slavery of the students? are they ok with this? why do they put up with it? how can i find out real? what is the impact on independent project creation, creativity, and independence?
- no fraud, no sleight of hand, the effort is purely about helping Huawei staff their engineering org and gain full independence from Western technology

  - DONT ASK STUPID QUESTIONS! Chinese are too good!
- https://github.com/lazyparser/weloveinterns/blob/master/how-do-we-rank-interns.md
  - Plct interns are categorized by levels, based on intelligence and knowledge, level 1-5
- Xiangshan project reports, yearly roadmaps and plans (very classic Chinese / communist methodology, but actually works!)
- Bejing institute of open source chip

- number of people is irrelevant. you may think the Chinese have an advantage due to the number of people they can command, but that isn't the case. Or even if it was, it wouldn't be possible with just a pool of people.
  - it is about leadership, vision, and drive of the leaders. If you look at the code contributors, the majority of projects are one man shows. One man drives everything downstream. The 'hero' is the most important character, and everyone else is his supporting cast.
  - The vision of the Chinese, supported by professors, students, industry allies, and the government is unified and real. No nonsense. Very honest.

  - "Nanjing University's award-winning Jiang Yanyan operating system experiment NJU-OS and MIT 6.828 which is more difficult to complete and the harvest is greater?"
  - This is the NJU OS class professor
  - He has some posts on the Chinese forums
- https://jyywiki.cn/Letter.md
  - this letter is too good, the extreme honesty of the Chinese is something to admire. Would an American professor dare to write such a letter? What is the use of 'free speech' in America if you are constantly restrained by taboos? What are the downsides of not being able to attack the CCP and Xi if you can openly state such extreme things with your name attached? American free speech used to have real meaning; not anymore.

- this is my fav chinese prof actually
  - he is also one of the main contributors to project-N - the NJU full-stack computer system project. NEMU is also part of this project.

- Chinese discuss whether RISC-V is a 'scam' in China or not. PLCT may have the external impression of marketing BS. Is it really worth it? Chinese openly debate these things on their public social media forums.
- WeChat supports Loongarch natively, but not RISC-V.
- Some understanding of the limitations of Xiangshan, immature project. Nationally funded startup will be necessary over an academic project if they want to make this commercially viable. Xiangshan generator is fragile and immature.
  - Random startups doing RISC-V core development in China, but they seem fishy. NoC, PCIe, periphery, software support startups are not so popular. (e.g. wechat doesn't support all architectures).
- zhihu - Q&A website for Chinese in all domains (not just engineering)
  - The prof himself responded to the question, very insane
