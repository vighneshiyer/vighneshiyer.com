I have more thoughts. Basically we know RTL simulation isn't feasible here, how do we pick the correct abstraction automatically? I argue sampling is the right approach, still backing the performance estimates with RTL. Extending the methodology to work for an entire SoC and SiP will be crucial. Switch models have to be validated against real things (in a MESS-style fashion).
