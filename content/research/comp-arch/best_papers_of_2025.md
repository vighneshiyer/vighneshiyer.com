## ASPLOS 2025

The Chinese presence has intensified. In the same way that Yanyan pointed out that SWE conferences have become "ChinaSoft", these "architecture" conferences have gone that way too.
One will note that for the papers I picked out, there are way fewer Chinese authors than the conference average.
Maybe this says something...

As usual, perhaps only 5% of papers are worth reading, with the rest being the usual "papers with code" nit optimizations or about things that are way off-topic for this conference.
Most papers are very tenuously related to the intersection of architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, which was the original point of this conference.
I will point out the ones I like.

- Rethinking Java Performance Analysis
  - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3669940.3707217
  - My pick for best paper of ASPLOS 2025
  - A good mix of philosophy, benchmark evaluation and construction, and the search for truth
- Control Logic Synthesis: Drawing the Rest of the OWL
  - https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3622781.3674170
  - Another good paper with a good idea
- Don't Repeat Yourself! Coarse-Grained Circuit Deduplication to Accelerate RTL Simulation
  - Beamer and his student do a good job, but are still just recovering the performance lost by Chisel/FIRRTL's abstraction blasting
- Parendi: Thousand-Way Parallel RTL Simulation
  - I am very happy to see his paper finally accepted to a conference after, I'm sure, many rounds of 'novelty' argumentation and bickering over performance improvements over multicore SW RTL simulation
  - I don't care about any of that nonsense - this is a worthy idea to explore and the authors did a good job with real engineering. That's all that matters.
- SmoothE: Differentiable E-Graph Extraction
  - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3669940.3707262
- Exo 2: Growing a Scheduling Language
  - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3669940.3707218
- Virgo: Cluster-level Matrix Unit Integration in GPUs for Scalability and Energy Efficiency
  - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3676641.3716281
  - Yes I'm biased, but this is good. Please read! Real engineering.
