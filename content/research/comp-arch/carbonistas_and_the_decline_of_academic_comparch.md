> Thrilled to share that we have 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝗽𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀 🏆✨accepted to present at hashtag#HotCarbon2025 in Cambridge, MA (July 10–11)! 🔥🧠 This year, we’re flipping the script on the carbon conversation in computing. Instead of stopping at CO₂, we dive into the hashtag#biodiversity and hashtag#water impacts of computing—from hashtag#LLMs to hashtag#datacenters to hashtag#fabs. 🌱💾

> 🚀 Meet FABRIC—our lifecycle modeling framework that bridges computing workloads and biodiversity risks. We introduce two new metrics:
>
>  • 🧬 EBI (Embodied Biodiversity Index)
>  • ⚡ OBI (Operational Biodiversity Index)

This feels like parody, but it's not.

## Weird Stuff in CompArch "Research"

- This is from my ASPLOS 2024 notes. Things started to get weird around that time (in late-2023) and have only been accelerating since.
- HotEthics, YArch weird stuff - the field is going into an odd status-seeking and virtue-signaling hole
- Even elite people like Lieven are doing this kind of weird stuff nowadays. Consider even Patterson has gone down this hole.
- Consider the broader context - does this work really matter? Who is pushing this stuff? Why? Does it advance our field?
- The role of the interests and highly charged ideologies of new students
  - Sustainable compute
  - LLM for xyz
  - Carbon
  - AI "safety"
- The Dark Age is here, who will lead us out of the tunnel?
- The root cause is that no one is willing to stake a clear definition of computer architecture, which would necessitate exclusion.
