# A Timeline of Computing

- Timeline
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computing
  - Similar style, but native CSS/HTML, and beautiful too
  - There are lots of these around the internet - but nothing is to my liking, naturally. I can do better. I also don't want a technology focus, but rather an architecture and trends focus.
- Research Labs
  - University of London
  - MIT Arvind's group
  - DEC legends
  - Bell Labs legends
  - IBM research
  - Intel Labs
- Heros across time
  - Shockley
  - Hamming
  - Shannon
  - Patterson
  - Asanovic
- Metrics
  - Cost / Gb
  - Max disk throughput
  - SPECint / W leader
  - DRAM throughput / latency
  - Clock frequencies
  - https://github.com/karlrupp/microprocessor-trend-data
  - Largest supercomputer arithmetic throughput
  - Networking / NIC throughput
  - Board-level serdes standards (PCIe +)

- Base technology (switch): Vaccum tubes, NMOS, planar CMOS, Finfet, ...
- Lithography: 300nm, ..., multi patterning, OPC, EUV, ..., 2nm
- Architectures: von Neumann, superscaler, out of order, multicore, GPU
- Parallelism: ILP, MLP, ...
- Programming abstractions: Lisp meta-programming, FP (lambda calculus), OOP (classes)
- Programming languages: punch cards, assembly, assemblers, COBOL, C, ...
- Technology trends: Dennard scaling, Moore's law, multicore, specialization
- Compilers: interpreters, ..., JIT, GC
- Prominent applications: ballistics, tracking, accounting, word processing, internet/browsers, video, social media, microservice architectures, games, LLMs
- Performance evolution: SPECint / MHz or W
- Specific timelines of products and innovations for:
  - Apple, Intel, AMD, ARM
