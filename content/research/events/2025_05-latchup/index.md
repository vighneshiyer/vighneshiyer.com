- The One Chip for Life talk was excellent, need to add some commentary there. Especially interesting as it was followed by the "European EDA" talk, which is laughable in comparison.
- Rachit's hardcaml talk was more about the concept of eDSLs with a final showcase of Hardcaml. Perhaps we will see a redesign soon. As noted in the jane street article, hardcaml's monadic HW types are interesting `UInt[Signal.t]` to switch between interpretation and circuit construction modes
- the bsg_pearls talk was much more interesting than I would have expected
- The Sunburst project (OpenPiton) seems interesting, but very corporate at this point
