  - Quite good overview with actual benchmarking results from Oracle cloud Apmere one instances, seems to be full custom ARM core by Ampere, very interesting tiny L1 icache 16kib unlike nearly all other datacenter (and mobile) cores on the market, but it still seems to not be frontend bound on small enough workloads, maybe that's what they are targeting? but it does seem odd since it will perform poorly with SpecJbb / JVM / any virtual machine I would guess
