# Shaping AI and the Laude Institute

A vision for Berkeley-style research labs for shaping AI by Patterson and Andy

- Doctors need a new model. Cartels exist at every level of the medical system - insurance that can't price risk, doctor schooling that is onerous, LLMs replacing doctors for diagnosis, need a new hospital model which is oriented around generalist doctors who perform operations and blood draws and imaging and a host of AI helping perform diagnosis
- pharmacy cartel, dentist cartel, optometry cartel - cartels everywhere!
- concierge medicine, people taking longevity into their own hands
- doctors will be very resistant to LLMs threatening any aspect of their cartel. at most they will like automatic appointment transcription. but actually this is a terrible way to integrate AI - AI needs to explore all possible ailments simultaneously to catch things that a doctor would often miss. the goal is to eliminate these cartels and insurance ultimately and return to the old model of medicine

Talk about the 4 moonshots

Engineering driven labs should be venture funded - just take a different view of the lab agenda from the time horizon perspective, abolish paper pushing
- big challenge this institute will have is working with the university cartel system, accreditation cartel, can they fund truly independent research centers where they have their own reputation pool and PhD granting process? seems very unlikely, but that must be the ultimate goal, since university reform is impossible (too many admins and people with interest in sinecures)

- people wanted these guys to replace the NSF. but the notion of the NSF funding engineering research is insane on its own. engineering must be industry funded. science can be a mix depending on what the outcomes and goals are. venture has never been as flush with cash as it is today - exploit it!

- andy is rich, laude will be set up with a philanthropy and venture arm that are independent, but ultimately the venture arm can invest in innovations / startups / labs on the grant side. this will provide incentive for other rich people to dump money into this, knowing that it is de-risked with the most early stage investment potential
  - venture funded research is the future imo. need to limit its downsides which is too much focus on product and not enough long term potential. investors need to accept risks and long time horizons and avoid messing with students. 

- limiting apps to 12 universities is kind of insane, the best people to lead these projects aren't even professors, they are people from industry who want to switch into mentoring young PhD students through a 5 year research and development cycle, who want to continue this moving forwards. uncomfortable truth is that the engineering PhD field must shrink considerably - most profs are not qualified and most students don't belong there.

- the moonshots are asking the impossible. but let me try to draft what my proposal for each one would look like as well as why they don't make much sense in the first place

- talk about patterson's points and why he is missing the context. the person comes before the principles, but he makes it seem like the principles can produce the lab! not true. in fact, this berkeley model doesn't exist anywhere else and has never shown success. professors are egoistic and not capable of working on a common vision. incompetence is too common. unable to focus outside paper pushing. at best, we saw this at the UMich micro mote lab, they actually put together something like this.

- patterson didn't talk about PARLAB and RAMP LAB and ASPIRE (he was gone) as home runs even though I think those have more *research* impact than even RAID. perhaps there is a bit too much historical retconning.

- collaboration across disciplines is fake
  - Multidisciplinary doesn't mean random domains under the same roof, it means across disciplines in the same area, like pl, compilers, analog circuits and so forth, maybe some domain crossover like genomics, commonly misunderstood
