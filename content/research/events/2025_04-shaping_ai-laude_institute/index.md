A vision for Berkeley-style research labs for shaping AI by Patterson and Andy

What is AI? To them it is just language models, at least from the moonshots they propose. They don't consider things like self-driving "AI" in this context, even though clearly it will induce demand with lower cost and eliminate jobs. In fact, I take issue with this notion of elasticity for goods where human labor itself becomes obsolete.

- Doctors need a new model. Cartels exist at every level of the medical system - insurance that can't price risk, doctor schooling that is onerous, LLMs replacing doctors for diagnosis, need a new hospital model which is oriented around generalist doctors who perform operations and blood draws and imaging and a host of AI helping perform diagnosis
- pharmacy cartel, dentist cartel, optometry cartel - cartels everywhere!
- concierge medicine, people taking longevity into their own hands
- doctors will be very resistant to LLMs threatening any aspect of their cartel. at most they will like automatic appointment transcription. but actually this is a terrible way to integrate AI - AI needs to explore all possible ailments simultaneously to catch things that a doctor would often miss. the goal is to eliminate these cartels and insurance ultimately and return to the old model of medicine

Talk about the 4 moonshots

Engineering driven labs should be venture funded - just take a different view of the lab agenda from the time horizon perspective, abolish paper pushing
- big challenge this institute will have is working with the university cartel system, accreditation cartel, can they fund truly independent research centers where they have their own reputation pool and PhD granting process? seems very unlikely, but that must be the ultimate goal, since university reform is impossible (too many admins and people with interest in sinecures)

- people wanted these guys to replace the NSF. but the notion of the NSF funding engineering research is insane on its own. engineering must be industry funded. science can be a mix depending on what the outcomes and goals are. venture has never been as flush with cash as it is today - exploit it!

- andy is rich, laude will be set up with a philanthropy and venture arm that are independent, but ultimately the venture arm can invest in innovations / startups / labs on the grant side. this will provide incentive for other rich people to dump money into this, knowing that it is de-risked with the most early stage investment potential
  - venture funded research is the future imo. need to limit its downsides which is too much focus on product and not enough long term potential. investors need to accept risks and long time horizons and avoid messing with students.

- limiting apps to 12 universities is kind of insane, the best people to lead these projects aren't even professors, they are people from industry who want to switch into mentoring young PhD students through a 5 year research and development cycle, who want to continue this moving forwards. uncomfortable truth is that the engineering PhD field must shrink considerably - most profs are not qualified and most students don't belong there.

- the moonshots are asking the impossible. but let me try to draft what my proposal for each one would look like as well as why they don't make much sense in the first place

- talk about patterson's points and why he is missing the context. the person comes before the principles, but he makes it seem like the principles can produce the lab! not true. in fact, this berkeley model doesn't exist anywhere else and has never shown success. professors are egoistic and not capable of working on a common vision. incompetence is too common. unable to focus outside paper pushing. at best, we saw this at the UMich micro mote lab, they actually put together something like this.

- patterson didn't talk about PARLAB and RAMP LAB and ASPIRE (he was gone) as home runs even though I think those have more *research* impact than even RAID. perhaps there is a bit too much historical retconning.

- collaboration across disciplines is fake
  - Multidisciplinary doesn't mean random domains under the same roof, it means across disciplines in the same area, like pl, compilers, analog circuits and so forth, maybe some domain crossover like genomics, commonly misunderstood

- patterson's talks: bad career, bad research center, and finally "how to have bad carbon emissions when doing AI" lmao, one is not like the other
- is this engineering research or politics?
- focus on trying to augment rather than replace humans is always fraught with difficulty - if the human can be completely replaced, why not? why do you expect others not to do this? won't your thing then be obsoleted by others?

  - The rapid upskilling prize, seems impossible, even LLMs are stumped

- Patterson is right about the principles, but wrong about how they come about. He seems to think if he just tells professors about them, they will understand and make it happen.
  - In reality, the principles are all about the leader. The person comes first, then the principles. There is a reason this berkeley lab model patterson talks about doesn't exist anywhere else, and it isn't because the principles aren't well known.
  - When recruiting, most people are blank slates when it comes to principles and philosophy, but most have some preconception of what they want out of grad school. If they are shooting for jobs or papers explicitly, then it is a bad sign. Nevertheless, the principles of the leader can have a huge impact on how people you recruit turn out and whether they play along and accomplish great things or if they devolve into menial paper pushers.
  - The people come first, then the principles emerge after distilling their actions. But the principles don't influence the people explicitly as a God might influence his people - they must be emergent!
