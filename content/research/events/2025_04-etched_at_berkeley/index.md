> Come meet the Etched team at 151T! Berkeley alum Mark Hill (EECS ‘19) will brief us on Sohu – the world’s first transformer inference ASIC – and share his insider’s perspective on what it takes to build frontier-class firmware. Mark was one of the first firmware engineers at Etched and previously the first firmware engineer at Astranis (a unicorn making high-orbit satellites).
>
> Etched is building a transformer-specific AI chip that's >10x faster than NVIDIA GPUs. Founded by Harvard dropouts turned Thiel Fellows, Etched has raised hundreds of millions from leading investors, including Peter Thiel, Jane Street, Two Sigma, and Primary Ventures. Engineering is led by Mark Ross (ex-CTO of Cypress Semiconductor [acq. 9.4B]);  Brian Loiler (ex-NVIDA for 23 years, built the HGX/DGX servers, responsible for >80% of NVIDIA’s revenue); and David Munday (built the TPU v1-v5 software/firmware teams).
>
> Undergrads, grad students, and researchers are all welcome to join for the agenda below. Please RSVP as space is limited.
>
> 4:30-5pm: Open discussion with the 151T class (anyone else on the guest list is welcome to join for Q&A)
>
> 5-6pm: Talk from Mark on designing and testing RTL+FW features for an ASIC
>
> 6-7pm: Food & Mingling with the Etched team, building the world's first transformer ASIC.

## Talk Notes

- The 3 guys: Carter Wilcox, Mark Hill, Robert Wachen
- No photos allowed
- Mark Hill about firmware engineering at Etched - first FW engineer there
- Talk title: Firmware for ASICs
- AI HW is the fastest growing market, growing need for specialized AI chips, we're about to make the first one
- All Harvard undergrads, they claim that AI model spend grows exponentially while cost of custom chips scales linearly at best
