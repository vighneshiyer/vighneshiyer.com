- When Markdown I sent someone was copied into Google docs to comment on it, that's wrong.
- What SW do we need to break that?
- Crdt and git is one.
  - The next git: there is some element of fossil that I like - keep PRs and other repo working state with the repo itself rather than an external service like Github
  - The major one is the ability to not think about version control explicitly. Allow continuous remote collaboration using language-aware CRDTs.
  - Be able to do the Google Docs workflow completely locally, with comment sync, threads, and resolution being part of the repo state for every given file (file-type specific)
- But also some new GUI for comments and back and forth via a text file, I don't want this file to leave version control, but I want to collaborate and comment on threads and use plain text
- Submodules...
- Large files...
- There is some overlap with the `code_driven_x.md` post
  - That post veered too much into the version control and hosting aspect, when it should be focused on the 2-way sync aspect between code and visuals

- Git worktrees
  - multiple things going off at once for throughput-oriented methodology
- No more submodules, something much better is required for ad-hoc dependencies
- Remote build server and execution + remote build cache to make git worktrees locally actually viable
- A repo is its own universe. Proper dependency and universe construction is required. Solutions like docker or Nix are only part of the way there
- A lot of ideas that Google has in their codebase are quite good in principle: Cider, CitC, Bazel (remote build execution + global build artifact caching)
